I am an optimist. I like to look on the bright side of things whenever I can. Whenever I am down I reset my thoughts by saying “it is what it is” and look for solutions. Now, this last year tended to be a very “It is what it is” kind of year, but I found that that is the exact thing I needed to say. With little control over our current situation I tried to make the best of the worst conditions. I worked to have fun and enjoy my junior year and make it my best year yet. And with my new attitude and new friends I had the time of my life. To give you an idea of what was upcoming for me I will give you the general overview. I was going to C dorm as the prefect that year. For me, C was like a Found family comedy like Friends or How I Met your Mother in which the cast would always get into some sort of crazy scenario and end up closer because of it. Because of this I will set the cast and stage so you can see from my point of view. Coming with me were two sophomores (Ryan and Flint), another junior (Matthew), and our one senior,(Joey) who was in C dorm previous years.  We all lived in C and it was one of the older dorms that had lots of faults that weren’t present in the new dorms. But no matter its faults and issues, C dorm made up for it in character and memories. Now that you have the general overview, let's begin. Despite having to go through quarantine before, I did not realize the extent to which quarantine meant in the dorms. Although I and the other Junior Matthew had cars, we were not allowed to leave at all. In fact, visits outside of our dorm became much more of a hassle because each house was declared its own “unit” and had to stick with their own. Now I am not saying that these rules were unjust, but they did make everything more - difficult. To start, our food situation wasn’t ideal. We would have food dropped off in our common room for us for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and the only constant was the poor quality food. We had the saddest chicken for breakfast and lunch most every day with equally awful dinners. But we knew that the quality wouldn’t change on its own so we took up the challenge to fix it. Armed with a hot plate and a simple Chef’s Knife, our master chef Flint would take control of the kitchen. At first it started by recooking the pork in the pork tacos and adding spices and other toppings, but it soon evolved to his specialty Chicken Sandwich. He would sear the chicken with a hot plate to give it a solid crust and he would make his own cane’s sauce. Combined with some toasted bread and smuggled vegetables, we are left with a pleasant sandwich.  We would do this for nearly every meal that we could fix as even though we couldn’t do much, we did what we could with what we were dealt. But not every meal could be fixed. Enter the enchiladas verdes. Although ideas popped up about a potential solution, we realized that some things can’t be fixed. And although nothing could directly fix it, we had prepared for this as we knew that somethings must start anew. Beforehand we went to the store and bought some steak, spinach, and other ingredients for our meal. With our three New York Strips in the freezer and hot plate on, with supervision, we started our feast. Accompanied by the delicate comedy of Southpark and by each other, we were happy. It didn’t matter that we were stuck or why we were stuck, we were happy. This “it is what it is” outlook soon spread to every aspect of our lives. We realized that we may not have had our conventional resources, but we had what we had. We had a group of very different people with various backgrounds and personalities and a Computer and occasional trips to target. So we did what we could with what we had. After classes in online school, we would often go out to the hall and stretch so then we could sit down and watch Southpark or some trash show on the History network. When we had classes together we would go outside and sit with one another. No more Friday movie trips? No problem! We set up our own movie night watching all sorts of movies like Parasite and Bruno. We then added game night playing Dark Souls, Smash Bros., and Undertale. We then ventured into horror games like Dead Space 3 and DDLC. This then led to each of us leading our own journeys. Joey would bring us deep into the Chinese version of Youtube being our tour guide to all the inside jokes. Matthew would lead us on our dorm repair with his janky ideas of “fixed” like paper shadings for hallway lights and a shower curtain as a doorway. The aforementioned Flint would contrast my optimism with his pessimism, cook, and show us his favorite absurdist Australian comedians. And Ryan would sit in his room and do Math homework. Meanwhile I was there watching it all and “supervising” where needed and egging on when I saw the opportunities for a stable level of chaos. Hair cuts? Well we got a $40 razer from Target and five boys giving their ideas of what looks “right”. No more going out for events? Well we have two full water bottles, cardboard boxes, and a hallway so we made a crude one on one bowling game. Every problem we faced we kept our chin up and figured out a solution or workaround. However, there is one problem I couldn’t fix. One Catastrophe that we can’t wait out. The Freeze. Through the night the snow gathered and gathered, and when we awoke it was piled up to amounts TMI hadn’t seen for some time. We had the privilege to see TMI under all that snow and it was amazing. My dorm all ventured out into the snow and we went as far as the lacrosse field. Although I complained of the temperature and my fingers freezing off for the whole time, I enjoyed it and thought it would be another memory dedicated to C Dorm. But when we got back, everything got worse. Our power went out and the temperature started going down. The apartment was below freezing and the common room was about 45 degrees. Although the option of going to a newer dorm was presented, we stuck together and bundled up in the common room watching a show on a laptop, weathering the storm. Spirits were still high despite the fact that temperature was low. We were dealing with our problems as well as we could while keeping a positive outlook but then everything came falling down, literally. We soon got told to evacuate the building as a portion of one of the other old dorms had collapsed along with the ceramics building due to freezing pipes and water troubles. But no matter the issue, we had to get out. All I could take was my backpack with my laptop and a few sets of clothes. We evacuated to Ewing, one of the relatively newer dorms, and set down our stuff. Once we settled in and calmed down, we were ready to assess our situation. Suddenly, a pipe burst right outside our room in the hallway. I grabbed my bags once more as water was filling the room and moved to Abbot this time. To say my optimism was still at 100% would be lying. I was on the verge of freaking out, keeping my composure just till I was alone. But to my surprise, Flint, our local pessimist, was doing what I couldn't. He remembered our backup steak that we had marinating in the C Freezer and started cooking it outside. He knew that everything was finally going the pessimistic route where nothing went right, but he made the best of the situation. He was standing outside in the below freezing weather and handing out pieces of our rainy day meal to whoever needed it. And then I realized how important this mindset is. Maybe Flint was just coping in his own way and doing what he was good at and enjoyed, but more to my point he knew what would make anything better. He acted in a way that improved all of our situations even if it wasn’t much. He did what he could and that is more than I can say for myself. With the snow melting and being able to return to my home in South Texas I had time to think about the situation. Time passed and I returned to Abbot after Spring break. With Ewing fixed, the Ewing kids could go back to their dorm, but the same could not be said for C dorm. My precious dorm was unsalvageable with water problems being found in the main dorm and more urgent water concerns in Dr. Leport’s apartment. Of course I was devastated but I knew that nothing could be done to save the building. I saw that we had the same people and the same opportunities for goofing off but still it was hard to lose such an important figure for us. As of my last quarter of Junior year, I am still in Abbot. We have grieved and are forced to face that it is what it is. My dorm is now an empty lot and some of us even got to observe it’s demolition. Our community had moved to Abbot but it wasn’t the same and nothing we could do would make it the same. We had caught lightning in a bottle and now it was gone. We still honor the dorm with each of us taking our own keepsakes of C dorm. I claimed a non working clock with algebra instead of numbers and a fire alarm. Others took photos and their own piece of the building. I even printed some vinyl stickers that say “mini C” to put on our dorm. Despite all this, we have recovered what we could. We aren’t the same group, but when Dr. Leport comes for dinner, we all sit around as a Dorm once again to chat and banter. We started to pick ourselves up again and returned to our mindset of “it is what it is” and started doing what we could to stay together. We go get fastfood and tailgate. We eat together during lunch and during all of our outings. There is still a bond that can’t be broken by a freeze. Now after all of this sorrow I recognize how important that attitude is. We could have gotten brought down by the pandemic and everyone that goes with it, the boredom, the loneliness, the sameness of everything, but we lasted. Our attitude of gratitude kept us upbeat and led to some of the best memories I have ever had. Poker nights while watching every single Twilight movie and the stupid mind games that came with it. Playing with the VR and cracking jokes while someone was cutting bullets in slow mo. Our showing of Parasite got too popular and had to be interrupted because too many of the other dormers were watching with us instead of going to community night. Even the times when I would have to climb a window or crouch down in a too small shower feel nostalgic because of my attitude. No matter the problem, our attitude made it better. We said “it is what it is” and got through everything and forged a bond that will last and be remembered. Whenever you face hardships, think back to what you can do to make your situation better. And if you need a starting point, I will tell you of the knowledge passed on to me by Joey, our oldest and wisest roommate. Putting dinosaur stickers on everything makes the world a bit better. Thank You. 
Are our lives important? I am not referring to political status, social status, economic status, or anything else of that nature; I am referring to the exact four simple words of this question. If you look at the grand scheme of the universe, it appears that we pose no significance at all. Before the creation of the universe, there was an empty void: silent, colossal, and devoid of any life.  At the birth of the universe, the void contained monumental planets and even more massive and scintillating suns of assorted colors, each of them unique from one another, but on a closer look, nothing else existed. The stars and worlds progressed through near-illimitable chronicles, but time was the weapon destroying these giants.  Planets and stars either vanished into the void or transformed over near-immeasurable spans of time.  The ones which persisted were altered drastically, with Earth transforming from an uninhabitable hell surrounded by massive craters filled with withering lava and an asphyxiating atmosphere to a beautiful world.  Hues previously absent materialized into a nature of flora and fauna of all shapes and sizes each having their own unique benefits within their own distinct homes.  Worlds, although changed, were still unimmune to time.  Although a percentage of the colorful prehistoric insects survived through multiple doomsdays, the larger animals are now fossilized into the Earth, only to be discovered in recent times by the intelligent species known as humans. As humans came into existence after the universe had already developed its masterpiece after an unimaginable amount of time, we gradually developed our species, eventually creating civilizations.  As we progressed through our existence, we craved more as we developed.  Quests for food converted into bloody quests for influence over others, with some emperors using others for dangerous or demoralizing entertainment.  The vibrant flora and fauna were replaced by a constant color of stone and wood as we fed our cravings, letting our planet’s past become a faded memory, not acknowledging the damage we were doing until it was too late.  As we industrialized, our species boomed, leading us to the eight billion humans today, but still, our species remains in chaos, not solely by violence, but because of the differences in our beliefs.  We have separated ourselves, becoming one with the hive, while we outcast others who do not believe in the same ideas we do, yet we undertake the same actions we ridiculed.  Most of us are miniscule paint drops on the canvas close to the massive marks made by a paint roller, while the original art of Earth is forgotten.  Unfortunately, the universe’s masterpiece currently sits in shambles.  We have slowly grown to be peacemakers, but we are still on an infinite journey to Utopia.  Similar to you, I look to be a lone mark of paint on the canvas of our universe, a minute mark, but still existent.  I am going through my own life with trials and tribulations, although different, from the people I sit by every day.When I was a toddler, I was creative and cheery.  I could bounce off the walls all day if I wanted to.  I was ecstatic to participate in every minor endeavor which could be considered fun. It was a good period of my life; I could play with my friends at birthday parties, the basketball court at my neighborhood’s playground, and at my house with my wrestling and superhero action figures, creating worlds and stories for them to inhabit.  When visiting my cousins, I acted the same way; I used my creativity to create different games for us to happily play and selected the video games to play on the Wii or Xbox 360.  When I was not with others, I spent most of my time playing video games or watching SpongeBob Squarepants.  Grades manifested in my mind solely as an afterthought, and as a result, I performed decently at school with the sight of all A’s on my report card existing only in my dreams. With my youth, oddly colored portions of paint pigment developed on my drop of the universal canvas.  My behavior was erratic, feeling as if my fluctuating volume and violently shaking hands were disconnected from the messages of my brain.  Internal problems were worsened by external senses as cars became tornado sirens, artificial light became intense rays of light from the sun, and grazes on my arm felt like a faint slap.  Although these afflictions were caused by excitement and how my body is wired, these afflictions were also catalyzed by schedule changes, feeling angry when something new was added to my schedule.  Even with my afflictions, I made friends, and I was allowed to use my toddler mind to create ideas, such as building a pro-wrestling stage made of cardboard with neon paint for my action figures; there was nothing important for me to worry about.  After becoming comfortable with my school, I was told moving schools would be the best option for me to make new friends and be in a safer environment; I agreed once I saw the campus, and by the end of my third grade year, I moved, leaving behind most of the friends I made. Transitioning to my new school was difficult, not only because of the change of the environment and people, but also my self-alteration.  From what I assessed from my shadow day and from what I learned from my parents, I believed I would have to adopt the persona of a five-star butler.  Academics were no longer an afterthought; they were paramount.  At first glance, my changes instituted positive effects; my newfound strive to be a perfectionist catapulted me to make straight A’s on my report card for the first time in my life.  Although I should have been more surprised at the time, I was simply content, but not shocked.  With this, I felt as if I needed to trade in most of my sociability to keep the effort I made already, and as this changed, my new school personality was created. Depending on who you talk to, the severity of my new personality’s exaggerated nature could have been mild to severe.  Even though the external sculpture of myself changed drastically, the inside remained stagnant.  Life, like stars and worlds, changes.  With changes in my life occurring more than ever, it was difficult for me to believe that my likes and dislikes were accepted by my peers.  During one of my basketball practices, I wore a sweatshirt indoors to hide my WWE TLC 2009 shirt due to the fact I believed others would ridicule me.  I felt that everyone else matured and moved on to grander hobbies while I still retained my childhood interests.  For me, there was no internal or external peace.  I wished I could act like everyone else so I could make close friends, but in my mind at the time, I was too different from everyone else.  Months passed and I realized the school was not as different from my old school as I previously thought; however, the damage was done.  My paint drop already had altered its color, meaning I could not return to the mindset I once had.  So, I had to continue my life with my new viewpoint. The concluding years of elementary school passed at a turtle’s pace.  By the time I graduated, I had completely familiarized myself with the school, and was optimistic about middle school.  To me, middle school seemed like a fantastic opportunity for more freedom and responsibility, opening myself to the first atoms of the real world.  My sixth-grade year expectations were different from reality, but I still enjoyed the unique environment for middle school.  When seventh grade arrived, the beginning was similar to the previous grade, but after the first few months, I began to feel perturbed.  The congenial life I believed I had quickly dissipated, and I realized it was only a microcosm of my seventh-grade year.  Rapidly, the likes and dislikes of others seemed to change again, sending me back in the loop I was caught in when I first entered the school.  Since the change was too instant and severe, I felt it was time to move schools once more.  At the end of the year, I prepared to arrive at my new school. I arrived here in my eighth-grade year with a new hope for the future, but was still fraught; I could finally become a better person, but to successfully do that, I would have to make drastic changes.  Once again, I attempted to become more social, but I was not as quick as I would have hoped.  The irritation of change, my flapping of hands, the blaring lights, and tumultuous sounds, while subsided, continued to be a persistent problem for me behind the scenes, causing my progress to be halted at multiple turns.  I thought to myself, “Why are my behaviors erratic and why are my likes inconsistent with those of others my age?”   I received my answer in mid-to-late 2021, when I was diagnosed with Level one ASD or mild autism.  Although relieved to receive answers with the official diagnosis, I started to notice the weight on my shoulders, realizing the true severity of my actions, emotions, and thoughts for myself and others around me.  For my entire life, I believed most of the actions caused by others dictated what I should do and how I should try to act, but finally glancing at myself and my role in the world, I realized what I did and will do matters. A question materialized inside my mind as if it were a ghost speaking to me, “Should I continue to live as I do now, or use my knowledge about my experiences to improve myself as a person?”  After contemplating, I decided on the latter.  In order to improve myself, I needed to find something I loved and intertwine my creative abilities; I found this with Dungeons and Dragons.  I proudly took over the Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) club after discovering my love for it during my freshman year.  I coordinate club meetings and describe the settings of the campaigns to the unintroduced adventurers, so they know what evils lurk in the shadows.  For the inexperienced players, I assist them in creating characters, gathering information, and slaying mighty beasts.  I am frequently the Dungeon Master, the storyteller and overseer for the adventurers, giving them strangers and foes to interact with.  I also provide answers to any questions the players ask and give updates to conditions such as being frightened or poisoned.  My newfound passion for D&D allowed me to eagerly talk to more people during lunch, make new friends with different friend groups including groups entitled the Drain Gang and DP Productions, and invite friends over to my house more frequently. Although D&D allowed me to fully integrate my creativity into an activity, it also catalyzed my love of scriptwriting, and now my computer is overloaded with Final Draft documents.  I love D&D and scriptwriting and would gladly spend my entire life continuing them, but what does this have to do with the first question?  You, me, and every sentient being on this planet are different in terms of appearance, but on a more detailed level, are also unique.  With ourselves and the people we interact with, our lives make an impact.  For at least one person in our lives, including ourselves, we matter to them, and that is something to remember.  Our lives are important. We see the world as an abstract canvas with splatters of diverse sizes of every color, the bigger the splatter, the bigger the significance of a person.  Unfortunately, we have made this concept true with our actions and beliefs.  We must remember that at the basic level of humanity, stripping away everything we have formed, we are all equal in importance even if our purposes on this Earth are different.  If one person were to not exist, the world would be severely altered.  We each have our own unique journeys and this fuels our purposes even more.  We all have a part to play in our lives and the lives of those who surround us, whether it be saying hello in the hallways or forming a deep friendship.  The decisions we make signify our importance because they make changes to the world, affecting it in a certain way.  Due to this concept, the dimensions of the universe’s canvas grow infinitely, and our uniqueness reigns over every aspect of our lives.  From the first creature created to the eight billion humans living today, each one of us is an equal speck of paint on the Earth’s canvas.  Truly, it is a beautiful sight to see how everything comes together. Somewhere, we are located on the universe’s canvas with every face we encounter in our respective lives.  It is crucial for us to remember, however, the important ability of choice is a gift, not a weapon; bad decisions have created permanent marks and scars upon the world and its inhabitants.  In our lives, these decisions are inescapable.  I am sure you could instantly think of some bad decisions you have made, and I admit, I am no stranger to these bad decisions.  I regret these bad choices I have made in the past and wish I could have the opportunity to undo them. We do not have many answers to the simple questions about humanity, but remember, take away every ranking, role, and stereotype, just focusing on the basics of humanity, you will find all of us are important in one way or another.  We can help guide our universe to one day reach peace by remembering that our decisions matter, and we are all important.
