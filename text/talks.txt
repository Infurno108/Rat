I am an optimist. I like to look on the bright side of things whenever I can. Whenever I am down I reset my thoughts by saying “it is what it is” and look for solutions. Now, this last year tended to be a very “It is what it is” kind of year, but I found that that is the exact thing I needed to say. With little control over our current situation I tried to make the best of the worst conditions. I worked to have fun and enjoy my junior year and make it my best year yet. And with my new attitude and new friends I had the time of my life. To give you an idea of what was upcoming for me I will give you the general overview. I was going to C dorm as the prefect that year. For me, C was like a Found family comedy like Friends or How I Met your Mother in which the cast would always get into some sort of crazy scenario and end up closer because of it. Because of this I will set the cast and stage so you can see from my point of view. Coming with me were two sophomores (Ryan and Flint), another junior (Matthew), and our one senior, (Joey) who was in C dorm previous years.  We all lived in C and it was one of the older dorms that had lots of faults that weren’t present in the new dorms. But no matter its faults and issues, C dorm made up for it in character and memories. Now that you have the general overview, let's begin. Despite having to go through quarantine before, I did not realize the extent to which quarantine meant in the dorms. Although I and the other Junior Matthew had cars, we were not allowed to leave at all. In fact, visits outside of our dorm became much more of a hassle because each house was declared its own “unit” and had to stick with their own. Now I am not saying that these rules were unjust, but they did make everything more - difficult. To start, our food situation wasn’t ideal. We would have food dropped off in our common room for us for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and the only constant was the poor quality food. We had the saddest chicken for breakfast and lunch most every day with equally awful dinners. But we knew that the quality wouldn’t change on its own so we took up the challenge to fix it. Armed with a hot plate and a simple Chef’s Knife, our master chef Flint would take control of the kitchen. At first it started by recooking the pork in the pork tacos and adding spices and other toppings, but it soon evolved to his specialty Chicken Sandwich. He would sear the chicken with a hot plate to give it a solid crust and he would make his own cane’s sauce. Combined with some toasted bread and smuggled vegetables, we are left with a pleasant sandwich.  We would do this for nearly every meal that we could fix as even though we couldn’t do much, we did what we could with what we were dealt. But not every meal could be fixed. Enter the enchiladas verdes. Although ideas popped up about a potential solution, we realized that some things can’t be fixed. And although nothing could directly fix it, we had prepared for this as we knew that somethings must start anew. Beforehand we went to the store and bought some steak, spinach, and other ingredients for our meal. With our three New York Strips in the freezer and hot plate on, with supervision, we started our feast. Accompanied by the delicate comedy of Southpark and by each other, we were happy. It didn’t matter that we were stuck or why we were stuck, we were happy. This “it is what it is” outlook soon spread to every aspect of our lives. We realized that we may not have had our conventional resources, but we had what we had. We had a group of very different people with various backgrounds and personalities and a Computer and occasional trips to target. So we did what we could with what we had. After classes in online school, we would often go out to the hall and stretch so then we could sit down and watch Southpark or some trash show on the History network. When we had classes together we would go outside and sit with one another. No more Friday movie trips? No problem! We set up our own movie night watching all sorts of movies like Parasite and Bruno. We then added game night playing Dark Souls, Smash Bros., and Undertale. We then ventured into horror games like Dead Space 3 and DDLC. This then led to each of us leading our own journeys. Joey would bring us deep into the Chinese version of Youtube being our tour guide to all the inside jokes. Matthew would lead us on our dorm repair with his janky ideas of “fixed” like paper shadings for hallway lights and a shower curtain as a doorway. The aforementioned Flint would contrast my optimism with his pessimism, cook, and show us his favorite absurdist Australian comedians. And Ryan would sit in his room and do Math homework. Meanwhile I was there watching it all and “supervising” where needed and egging on when I saw the opportunities for a stable level of chaos. Hair cuts? Well we got a $40 razer from Target and five boys giving their ideas of what looks “right”. No more going out for events? Well we have two full water bottles, cardboard boxes, and a hallway so we made a crude one on one bowling game. Every problem we faced we kept our chin up and figured out a solution or workaround. However, there is one problem I couldn’t fix. One Catastrophe that we can’t wait out. The Freeze. Through the night the snow gathered and gathered, and when we awoke it was piled up to amounts TMI hadn’t seen for some time. We had the privilege to see TMI under all that snow and it was amazing. My dorm all ventured out into the snow and we went as far as the lacrosse field. Although I complained of the temperature and my fingers freezing off for the whole time, I enjoyed it and thought it would be another memory dedicated to C Dorm. But when we got back, everything got worse. Our power went out and the temperature started going down. The apartment was below freezing and the common room was about 45 degrees. Although the option of going to a newer dorm was presented, we stuck together and bundled up in the common room watching a show on a laptop, weathering the storm. Spirits were still high despite the fact that temperature was low. We were dealing with our problems as well as we could while keeping a positive outlook but then everything came falling down, literally.
Throughout my life, I have been given many different names. These include “little Kyle”, “the youngest Kyle”, “the last of the Kyles”, “the baby of the family”. I have even been called “pipsqueak”, a name first given to me by my aunt, but then so lovingly adopted by my oldest brother, more based on the fact that I am the shortest out of my siblings than the youngest, but a name that I have been referred to as nonetheless. The majority of my life has been based on my three older siblings. I have gone to the same schools as them, taken the same classes, played the same sports, and tried all of the same hobbies. This led me to being a very annoying little sister, which I have unfortunately always been aware of thanks to one of my brothers. For the most part though, my siblings have been very accepting of my constant desire to tag along and ask incessant questions, even when seeking their acceptance has led to major regret and quite a bit of crying. As a kid I would get scared very easily. That’s not to say that I don't anymore, but it is not nearly as bad as having nightmares about the movies Jaws and Gremlins for months after watching them. My sister was forced to deal with my constant paranoia before falling asleep every night during those periods considering we shared a bedroom for the majority of my life. However, I was always convinced that I would be able to make it through the same scary things as the rest of my family. Hence why when my parents brought up the idea of going to the haunted house, "The Nightmare on Elm Street," I attempted to convince everyone else of my bravery. Keep in mind, I was eight. There was no sign that I would be able to successfully make it through a haunted house. I could barely even handle playing "Call of Duty'' because I got startled by other players coming around a corner in front of me. Despite this, I had far too much faith in myself. My siblings knew better. They remembered my fear more clearly than I had, but I insisted that this time it would somehow be different. I am still unsure why anyone thought to even consider letting four children into a haunted house like that. Given that there are at least ratings on movies, I would have expected some sort of age limit, preferably one that was higher than eight. For some reason though, my parents caved in and bought the tickets. It was possibly thanks to what I would like to call my “youngest child charm,” also known as annoying my entire family and begging until my parents said okay. 
I was 13 years old when my father decided to walk out of my life. If I am being honest, he had left my family long before he physically walked out the door. You learn quickly when bad things like this happen, it is either learn to cope or decide to cave. When my father left I think I did both. Facing the music of my reality, there was a lot of crying and letting little things get to me. Luckily, I like roller coasters so this ride of emotion called “cold reality” was starting to hit home. In today’s world, “coping” is an often used buzzword but I don’t think most of us grasp the true meaning of “coping.”  For those who don’t know what coping is let me give you the dictionary definition:   “to deal effectively with something difficult.” True coping requires more than just “dealing” with it, you need to do it effectively and it became clear pretty quickly I didn’t understand that part of it. ​To “cope” with his leaving I turned to video games and sleeping. When I played games it took me to a different world, a world where I did not have to deal with the thoughts and feelings I had about my situation at hand. However, because of this, my grades reflected this unhealthy coping method. My grades were dropping and the mask I put on at school was starting to slip off. Sadly I didn’t make any changes and my future is affected because of my inability to realize that I was not really coping. Yes, video games are fun and made me feel better, but all it was doing was keeping me occupied until I turned the video games off and those thoughts and feelings I thought I was handling reared their ugly head again. It became clear I was only escaping what I needed to face. Another mechanism I thought was coping was just avoiding anything that had to do with my father. It seemed easier than trying to explain our strange and new family dynamic.  As terrible as it seemed for this to happen 3 days before Thanksgiving, I was kind of thankful it surrounded a holiday because I didn’t have to see anyone. I didn’t have to explain I wasn’t with my parents or why my mom was so sad or why I didn’t want to get out of bed.   Even now, anytime I have a conversation with him as the topic I get physically uncomfortable and I feel sick. I am a work in progress. Healthy coping is when there is a positive outcome and you have positive relationships. I put on a facade so I wouldn’t have to talk about it, to anyone. As it turns out, that wasn’t coping, that was avoidance.  I was struggling in school; I wasn’t progressing in the Corps; and I was separating myself from my friends.  Then we had a Pandemic.  Each of us has a “Covid” story.  Covid was in some way a great outlet for me because it allowed me to further isolate.  School as we knew it ended.  The world shut down but no one understood my world had already closed its borders.  School finally “resumed” virtually but Zoom classes were not my friend.  It turns out, even an introvert needs people. It was still easier for me to hide. I did not excel.  I failed to turn in assignments I had actually completed.  I took naps during lunch instead of eating and was frequently late for class.  At one point, one of my teachers finally realized something was off because I had failed to turn on my camera after being asked many times. I did not want to be seen.  Luckily, he held me accountable and I couldn’t hide anymore.  In hindsight, it was a gift, but I still failed to communicate my circumstances. I knew I wasn’t the only person at TMI to experience divorce.  Although, I can say, my circumstances were like a script for a tragic movie.  While other kids of divorce were juggling life and seeing parents on alternate weekends, and how to navigate holidays, I was trying to steer my way through my father calling the police because I did not want to go with him. There still wasn’t a clear gauge of how to cope. There’s not enough time to explain everything my mom and I endured but it seemed too far surpass what the majority of my peers faced with divorce. At one point my mom finally said, “Everyone has struggles,” and if you know my mom, it’s easy to envision what that sounded like.  It wasn’t minimizing my sadness but it reminded me that I wasn’t alone.  My circumstances may have been unique but struggling wasn’t specific to me.  There it was again, the theme:  cope or cave.  Caving obviously wasn’t working. That summer I read a book by Mark Manson with a questionable title but a perfect message:  “Don’t hope for a life without problems…There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.” ​My problem still wasn’t “good” but it was manageable.  Somewhere in the midst of all my struggles, my life began to change into something positive.  My mom met a man who made us a family again.  I call him “Step-Doug.”  My world changed from, “I was 13 when my father walked out of my life,” to “I was 14 when I met my dad.” Step-Doug said to me early on, “Stick with me kid, I’ll give you a better life.”  Sure, I still had problems but they were better problems. ​There is a lot I learned from my situation and how we really need to help others and cope.  Firstly, don’t assume you know someone’s narrative.  Not everyone knows how to express their trauma or how to cope with it.  For those that thought I was failing, every day I made it to school, I had already climbed out of a hole to get here.   In the words of Mark Manson, “You can’t be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others.” I may have seemed like the latter to some but I would eventually find myself again.  And if something seems off with someone, simply ask, “are you ok?,” because it could make a world of difference. Coping is to “deal effectively with something difficult.”  I am still learning how to put this into action but each day is a new opportunity.  We are all artists of our own stress and anxiety and sometimes the piece we keep picking up we’re simply putting in the wrong place.  I learned recently that the motto and my mom’s family crest is:  Dum Spiro Spero which means, “while I breathe I hope.”  Never give up hope. 
Life is like a beast, always moving, changing, and growing, but it will devour you if you don’t keep up with it. An interpretation of Charles Darwin once said, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.” Let me say that again, it is not the strongest or smartest who survive, but those who can adapt.  We all have this in common, at some point we will all have to face adversity in some form or another. In this interpretation, survivors don’t power through it or outthink it, they adapt to it to win.  We all wish there was some way to hit the pause button on life and maybe even a cheat code around the hardest parts, but they don’t exist. There is no way to stop life from going forward, no matter what someone may go through, we as people need to be able to adapt to survive. As you can probably guess, lacrosse has taught me a lot about life. If you do not know, lacrosse is a full-contact sport that requires you to drive through the defenders to get a goal.  Sometimes you dodge, sometimes you dive, and most times you get hit.  Everyone who has played lacrosse with me knows that I am known for getting hit. Hit pretty hard in fact. So hard, they gave me a nickname: Gumby. That name is not because I get hit hard though.  It’s because no matter how hard, I still get up. I do this because what is the point of staying on the ground? If I have not suffered a severe injury, why stay down?
Oftentimes, I believe myself to be one of the unluckiest people on Earth. While this isn’t uncommon for your average teenager, I happen to have this feeling quite frequently. As a control freak, I keep my grip on reality by attempting to limit negative outcomes while maximizing positive ones. To me, the idea of something being entirely out of my control is unnerving and frustrating. Unfortunately, no one can control everything because life inherently involves luck and chance. Often, I feel as if I always pull the short straw, and as I’ve grown, my own circumstances have continued to make life an increasingly risky game. But if given the opportunity to gain complete control over my life, I wouldn’t take it because over the past seven years, my life’s unlucky and uncontrollable situations have undoubtedly shaped me into a better person. If you don’t know me personally, I have a very tragic talent for being extremely clumsy. For me, the seemingly simple act of walking often leads to bruises and scratches. As an athlete, clumsiness-- along with a strong competitive nature-- opens up a multitude of opportunities for broken bones, twisted ankles, and pulled muscles. (As you can see right here with my broken wrist so being on this stage with stairs right in front of me is extremely scary). 
I distinctly remember waking up to the sound of my alarm blaring to an all too familiar sound. I slammed the top of the alarm as I had every morning before, but I knew this morning was different. Up until that moment the true reality of what I had gotten myself into had not truly settled in, the days and months leading up to me coming to TMI had seemed more like preparation for a summer camp than moving into a boarding school, but in that moment staring at my ceiling as my roommate stirred across the room, everything suddenly hit me at once. The only thing left in my mind was the thought, “I messed up really bad this time”.  School had been one of the places I despised most in the world, and now I had gotten myself stuck living there for the rest of the year. The strenuous series of events that ended up with me standing here today all started 2 years before I first came to TMI. 
It is my opinion that any chapel talk that hopes to stick into the tiktok length attention span of the average TMI students brain, needs to clearly state what it's about very early on in the talk while all the listeners are still awake.To put it bluntly I want to talk about time, specifically how we handle it with our habits and how making tiny changes now can change the trajectory of your whole life. Now, the genesis of this talk is a TMI 2015 convocation day video, which was in fact the first glimpse I had into TMI life before I was a student, and it got me thinking about time. Every single person in that video, with the exception of some of our ancient faculty and staff, is no longer ats TMI .when that video was filmed however they were just students at TMI, same as me and you however the main difference between them and you currently is that their time as a highschool school student, is over, its finished for them, but for you, its not, you still have time left here, whether that be years or 77 days exactly including today.
Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity. Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are the type of person who likes music. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete. Each time you encourage your cadets, you are a leader. Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. 
Every day from kindergarten to 8th grade, we would have a daily chapel to begin every school day. These chapel days would be led by the school’s headmaster, Mr. Webster. Mr. Webster is not only one of the best speakers I have ever heard, not only one of the best role models ever, but he is one of the best people I have ever met. He is the example of a perfect, loving person. Mr. Webster, also known as El Guapo, is a tall man who loves wearing his suits with blue jeans. He is someone who made an impact on everyone. Ask anyone who knows him, and they will say how much they love him. Even when I went to my sister’s chapel talk back in 2015, I was asked many times by TMI faculty about Mr. Webster. Everyone knows him because he just is so great. Everyday during chapel, he would show a clip of a movie, and then he would talk about a life lesson that was shown in that movie. He would talk about laziness or how to use our values to bring up a better life for ourselves. There are infinitely many quotes he had that are beautiful, however, my favorite one is “Let love and honesty rule your life.
Not only that, but I have been since I was five years old. Growing up in a house that primarily spoke Arabic and French, those languages came to me naturally. Altering every word, creating new words, and switching to different languages in one sentence is commonplace in my household. My mom and dad were both born in Lebanon, a small country located in the Middle East. My mom is fully Lebanese, and my father is half French and half Armenian. Growing up in Lebanon, French and Arabic were their first two languages, so there was no doubt that their two children would eventually learn them too. They both came here as young adults, and although adjustment was difficult, they seemed totally fine with their dichotomous world: American outside the house and something different at home. They appeared at ease with different foods, different music, and even different humor, matching their surroundings at any moment. They had friends that were like them and other, more traditional Americans, for lack of better words. Early in my life, I never realized this complexity. It was perfectly normal for me to watch Spongebob and Sesame Street in English while simultaneously speaking in Arabic or French to my mother. At times, I would also watch cartoons or acrobats on the French satellite channel TV5. And to be quite honest, I thought this is what everyone else did too. I was in, what I would call, an ethnic enclave. It was the same for my brother. I enjoyed my Lebanese and French dishes cooked by my mom while also occasionally enjoying a hot dog, a burger, or mac and cheese. I didn’t have much American influence at home, but I never felt out of place. I never seemed to question who and where I was and how I got here. As I started school, things got more complicated.
“All in”, I announced, as an over-hyped me pushed my dignity along with every single one of my chips into the center of the poker table. I stared right into Chris Goldsbury’s clear blue eyes as I shoved everything into the pot, hoping to catch the slightest glimpse of stress or uncertainty in his face gained from my calling his bet. To my horror, he just aimed his usual friendly smile back at me. It was only him and I left in the hand, and we had both put it all on the line. It was the final hand of the night, and I had chosen to leave my fate in the hands of luck. Lucky for me, I had been having no shortage of it that night. Just five minutes prior to going all in, I was balling. I felt like I had luck on my side and was on top of the world as I had been winning so much that I was ready to cash in my chips and go buy both Boardwalk and Park Place.
I was never a perfect student, I got A’s on occasion but I was mostly a B student which meant I was average, mediocre, and unremarkable. My academics were not particularly noteworthy or impressive. I would go to school and constantly look for distractions to get me out of class. I would talk with my friends, ask to go to the restroom, or even enjoy the occasional fire drill just to skip that little bit of class. Distractions gave me the ability to forget that I was just an average student. As a result of my lack of focus and dedication to my studies, I often found myself behind in class becoming below average. I would struggle to keep up with the material, and my grades would suffer as a result. I would try to make up for it by studying harder and putting in more effort, but it was always an uphill battle. I was never able to fully catch up, and I would always end up feeling lost, frustrated, and discouraged, but then we hit this one unit in science class - life cycles. This topic caught my interest and made me think. For the first time, I found myself looking forward to going to class. I was fascinated by the way that different organisms developed and changed over time. 
"Why am I doing this?" That was a question I had in mind ever since middle school. Korea’s education system makes everyone fixate on grades and getting into those top 3 colleges, resulting in the craze of after school academies trapping students often past midnight every single day. During my time in Korea, where I spent most of my life, I didn’t know the purpose of me as a person. I felt like I was just wasting my time doing homework, for just some quiz, and a rank that didn't mean much. Summer of 2019, I decided, I needed a break from this cycle. My parents and I decided to look into studying abroad, which was always in the back of my father’s mind. When we found TMI, we fell in love. It was a small private school, away from the city, surrounded by nature. As I was looking for something completely different from my experience in Korea, it was perfect. Stereotypical statement from immigrants, but for me, America really was the land of opportunities. It was a second chance in life where I was given a blank canvas and was able to make that painting whatever I wanted it to be. However, this new painting I had to do was very far from home, and very far from what I was used to. Living by myself, alone in the dorms was probably the biggest change other than the language & cultural barrier I experienced. 
Being one of the only teenagers there, he even gave me a position as altar server. Also with my late grandfather being a very devoted catholic, I felt at home connecting to god, and connecting to my family through him. By reconnecting with religion and some Korean food, I found myself recharging every time I went to church. I also had my closest friends, Jeongho and Matthew. We lived together for three years, and they are like my brothers now. Although we often argued about dumb stuff like why you shouldn’t have rice with chopsticks, we had a lot of fun together. I remember the three of us going to cars and coffee on saturday mornings, or the regular trips to Target to buy useless stuff. I’m grateful for these guys, always being by my side throughout the years. And on top of that, I was lucky enough to have Major Claburn and his family to let me stay at their house over one of the breaks. Mrs.Claburn treated me like her own son, and would invite me over for dinner often. Julia and William were like the annoying siblings I never had, and Major, although not too talkative, cooked me the best steak dinners with his grill setup. They provided me with the warmth of family, and some warm and delicious t-bone steaks. Realizing the support of all these people around me, I was able to dust myself off and pull myself back together. This time I decided, I’ll set achievable goals for myself, and each time I complete those, I'd set new goals that were, again, easily achievable. I started by taking cold showers everyday, cut down on caffeine and sweets, and worked out more often. 
just how lucky I am, I also understood how important it would be to remember that very moment. This realization contributed to my personal growth and changed how I understand my place in this world. Without it, I might have gone through life assuming that all I was given is normal. 
I am one of 6 kids, growing up everything felt like a competition. Who was the best behaved? Who helped the most around the house? Who was the best at mario party? Who was the best at singing? It all felt like one massive triathlon, with the grand prize being attention. I quickly ruled myself out of most of those competitions, but the one thing I decided I could stand my ground in was the smart competition, so I chose that one to focus my energy on. I didn’t care that I wasn’t the most athletic in my family, or the funniest, or that I wasn’t the best at singing. I cared about the “who was the smartest” competition.
“Not all that COUNTS can be COUNTED, -and not all that can be COUNTED, -COUNTS” Originally I had Two chapel talks, and Fr. Ben said “You only have ONE talk” so I had to make it count. I’m Going to tell you a couple of stories that have taught me what really counts. Picture this. - It's the first day of high school and I am brand new to TMI. I have my new uniform on, with some fresh khaki shorts and I am nervous yet excited to see what TMI is all about. My parents dropped me off at the flag circle and I headed into the gym for a meet and greet for new families and students.
Waking up to the sound of birds with the sun shining through the trees suddenly turns into the sound of construction and massive buildings blocking the light and casting a gloomy shadow into my room. The mountain I grew up on where you could drive for miles only seeing nature suddenly became driving through traffic with skyscrapers surrounding the view. For most of my life I grew up in Waynesville, North Carolina. It was a town where there wasn't much to go and do,  but there was a lot to see. 
I spent day after day doing what I used to look forward to: resting with my head on a pillow. I didn’t realize how bad this was at the time, though. However, my mom used her mother's instinct and saw this much more apparently than I did. She informed our relatives of our situation, and my aunt drove down from Dallas despite her and my uncle’s upcoming plan: a hiking trip to Utah With both my mom and aunt having a mother’s instinct, they made an arrangement so my twin sister and I could join my aunt and uncle on this unexpected getaway. 
As I scanned through images of Zion National Park on my phone, I couldn’t help but have an ounce of dread as I imagined climbing rocks in the heat for days on end. I was at a place in which sleeping seemed the only suitable thing to do. But of course, I was excited and grateful for this trip. I was also full of anticipation. Having a mom who plans trips a year in advance, the spontaneity of it all was a completely new experience. 
If you were to join a Lacrosse team, what number would you choose to put on the back of your jersey? Perhaps your lucky number or the number of a famous athlete you admire? Maybe the number in your mind has a personal connection to you or a story behind it. I know the number 25 is near to my heart because it's the number that I have worn while I have played lacrosse at TMI. It is the number that I won a State Championship in and the  number I have worn while making long-lasting friendships and memories that will last forever. 
My favorite song lyrics come from a well-known Brazilian Bossa, Desde Que o Samba é Samba by Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. The lyrics in Portuguese “Solidão apavora. Tudo demorando em ser tão ruim. Mas alguma coisa acontece no quando agora em mim. Cantando eu mando a tristeza embora.” For those who don’t understand Portuguese, these song lyrics approximately translate to: “The loneliness terrifies; The worst is yet to come; But something presently happens in me; By singing, I send the sadness away”.
Rome was not built in a day, and neither is any civilization. Humankind, or Homo Sapiens, or Cro Magnons, or whatever you would like to call us, have been around for about sixty-thousand years. We started out as what we might refer to as “cavemen”, but, slowly but surely, over the course of sixty-thousand years, managed to invent vaccines and supercomputers, master both sea and sky, and spread ourselves and our parking lots over nearly every corner of the Earth. So the question, then, is how? What exactly is it that turned a bunch of primates in a cave into a bunch of primates in a Whataburger parking lot? How did we get here? 
Armed with a hot plate and a simple Chef’s Knife, our master chef Flint would take control of the kitchen. At first it started by recooking the pork in the pork tacos and adding spices and other toppings, but it soon evolved to his specialty Chicken Sandwich. He would sear the chicken with a hot plate to give it a solid crust and he would make his own cane’s sauce. Combined with some toasted bread and smuggled vegetables, we are left with a pleasant sandwich.  We would do this for nearly every meal that we could fix as even though we couldn’t do much, we did what we could with what we were dealt. But not every meal could be fixed. Enter the enchiladas verdes. Although ideas popped up about a potential solution, we realized that some things can’t be fixed. And although nothing could directly fix it, we had prepared for this as we knew that somethings must start anew. Beforehand we went to the store and bought some steak, spinach, and other ingredients for our meal. With our three New York Strips in the freezer and hot plate on, with supervision, we started our feast. 
We still honor the dorm with each of us taking our own keepsakes of C dorm. I claimed a non working clock with algebra instead of numbers and a fire alarm. Others took photos and their own piece of the building. I even printed some vinyl stickers that say “mini C” to put on our dorm. Despite all this, we have recovered what we could. We aren’t the same group, but when Dr. Leport comes for dinner, we all sit around as a Dorm once again to chat and banter. We started to pick ourselves up again and returned to our mindset of “it is what it is” and started doing what we could to stay together. We go get fastfood and tailgate. We eat together during lunch and during all of our outings. There is still a bond that can’t be broken by a freeze. Now after all of this sorrow I recognize how important that attitude is. We could have gotten brought down by the pandemic and everyone that goes with it, the boredom, the loneliness, the sameness of everything, but we lasted. Our attitude of gratitude kept us upbeat and led to some of the best memories I have ever had. Poker nights while watching every single Twilight movie and the stupid mind games that came with it. Playing with the VR and cracking jokes while someone was cutting bullets in slow mo. Our showing of Parasite got too popular and had to be interrupted because too many of the other dormers were watching with us instead of going to community night. Even the times when I would have to climb a window or crouch down in a too small shower feel nostalgic because of my attitude. No matter the problem, our attitude made it better. We said “it is what it is” and got through everything and forged a bond that will last and be remembered. Whenever you face hardships, think back to what you can do to make your situation better. And if you need a starting point, I will tell you of the knowledge passed on to me by Joey, our oldest and wisest roommate. Putting dinosaur stickers on everything makes the world a bit better. Thank You.  Sadly I didn’t make any changes and my future is affected because of my inability to realize that I was not really coping. Yes, video games are fun and made me feel better, but all it was doing was keeping me occupied until I turned the video games off and those thoughts and feelings I thought I was handling reared their ugly head again. It became clear I was only escaping what I needed to face. Another mechanism I thought was coping was just avoiding anything that had to do with my father. It seemed easier than trying to explain our strange and new family dynamic.  As terrible as it seemed for this to happen 3 days before Thanksgiving, I was kind of thankful it surrounded a holiday because I didn’t have to see anyone. I didn’t have to explain I wasn’t with my parents or why my mom was so sad or why I didn’t want to get out of bed.   Even now, anytime I have a conversation with him as the topic I get physically uncomfortable and I feel sick. I am a work in progress. Healthy coping is when there is a positive outcome and you have positive relationships. I put on a facade so I wouldn’t have to talk about it, to anyone. As it turns out, that wasn’t coping, that was avoidance.  I was struggling in school; I wasn’t progressing in the Corps; and I was separating myself from my friends.  Then we had a Pandemic.  Each of us has a “Covid” story.  Covid was in some way a great outlet for me because it allowed me to further isolate.  School as we knew it ended.  The world shut down but no one understood my world had already closed its borders.  School finally “resumed” virtually but Zoom classes were not my friend.  It turns out, even an introvert needs people. It was still easier for me to hide. I did not excel.  I failed to turn in assignments I had actually completed.  I took naps during lunch instead of eating and was frequently late for class.  At one point, one of my teachers finally realized something was off because I had failed to turn on my camera after being asked many times. I did not want to be seen.  Luckily, he held me accountable and I couldn’t hide anymore.  In hindsight, it was a gift, but I still failed to communicate my circumstances. I knew I wasn’t the only person at TMI to experience divorce.  Although, I can say, my circumstances were like a script for a tragic movie.  While other kids of divorce were juggling life and seeing parents on alternate weekends, and how to navigate holidays, I was trying to steer my way through my father calling the police because I did not want to go with him. There still wasn’t a clear gauge of how to cope. There’s not enough time to explain everything my mom and I endured but it seemed too far surpass what the majority of my peers faced with divorce. At one point my mom finally said, “Everyone has struggles,” and if you know my mom, it’s easy to envision what that sounded like.  It wasn’t minimizing my sadness but it reminded me that I wasn’t alone.  My circumstances may have been unique but struggling wasn’t specific to me.
The team and I took a breath and came together to see what we had learned. With this, our team was able to adapt to the circumstances.  We could adapt to the situation and overcome the problems that people had. How did that work for us?  Right off the bat, we were able to score a goal. Then on Reagan’s next offensive possession, we were able to stop them from scoring. We adapted to their style of play and got back up from that big 4 goal “hit.” This adaptation gave us what we needed to go on a non-stop scoring spree. We won that game… by a lot! When situations are looking rough the only way to fix them is to slow down, observe your surroundings, and then act upon them and adapt. Even when I was young I had to learn how to adapt. When I was about 5 years old I lived in Red Bank, New Jersey.
We need to adapt to these situations to meet new people, make new friends, and learn new things. Then, after college, we need to adapt to the working world.  We need to find jobs and homes of our own. The excitement and worries that the future has in store for me are something I will learn to change with.  The world will not be easy on me, I need to change with life instead of against it. From college to jobs, to new friends, to changed relationships. The world is changing around us, are you prepared to change with it? I know you will because we have all learned to adapt. Thank you. 
Oftentimes, I believe myself to be one of the unluckiest people on Earth. While this isn’t uncommon for your average teenager, I happen to have this feeling quite frequently. As a control freak, I keep my grip on reality by attempting to limit negative outcomes while maximizing positive ones. To me, the idea of something being entirely out of my control is unnerving and frustrating. Unfortunately, no one can control everything because life inherently involves luck and chance. Often, I feel as if I always pull the short straw, and as I’ve grown, my own circumstances have continued to make life an increasingly risky game. But if given the opportunity to gain complete control over my life, I wouldn’t take it because over the past seven years, my life’s unlucky and uncontrollable situations have undoubtedly shaped me into a better person. If you don’t know me personally, I have a very tragic talent for being extremely clumsy. For me, the seemingly simple act of walking often leads to bruises and scratches. As an athlete, clumsiness-- along with a strong competitive nature-- opens up a multitude of opportunities for broken bones, twisted ankles, and pulled muscles. (As you can see right here with my broken wrist so being on this stage with stairs right in front of me is extremely scary). Since the fifth grade, I haven’t gone a year without at least one injury. Clearly, this is a bit unlucky, right? At first, I thought so too. In my book, however, those were the lucky injuries. Those were the ones I could always bounce back from. On the other hand, my unluckiest and most consistent talent, which basically defines my entire athletic career, is my unnatural and surprising ability to get a concussion in any given situation.
I procrastinate a lot, spend too much time on my phone, and forget things all the time. However, after learning to accept the new and unfortunate limitations of my brain, I learned the importance of redefining my goals. For me, this meant placing emphasis on things that I am actually passionate about such as photography, science, reading, and most unexpectedly, soccer. And for those of you wondering how I managed to convince my mother to let me even step foot on a soccer field again, this monstrosity is how (display THE HORRIBLE EVIL CONCUSSION HELMET). But by focusing on my capabilities rather than my inabilities, I’ve been able to adapt, relearn, and rediscover what truly makes me happy despite the hardships I faced last year.
Catie and I huddled together watching them work on my dad until she said that we should stop watching and took us to an area beside the clinic to wait for the ambulance.   I told her to call Mom and tell her what happened.  As Catie spoke to her, I kept thinking- Dad is dead. Dad is dead. That morning, I was so moody and grumpy and wasn’t nice to him.  Not remembering exactly what I said, I knew it wasn’t good and couldn’t bear the thought that the last moments spent with him, I treated him poorly.  I asked to talk with my mom.  Hearing the fear in her voice, I explained how badly I had treated my father and how I couldn’t live with it if the last words I spoke to dad were mean ones.  I broke down and I had never felt more scared. Not like’ starring in a horror movie’ scared, but genuinely scared of losing one of my favorite and most dearly beloved people and my life changing in a terrible way.8:33am The EMTs revived my dad after 70 compressions and 3 shots of epinephrine, but we did not know if his brain function was okay or if he was going to make it. My mom arrived and we followed the ambulance to the hospital.  While driving, Mom would pray one minute, cry another, and then say it must not be too bad if the ambulance was moving so slowly.  I know she was trying to keep us calm and positive.  I was so confused and in shock-one second my dad was fine, the other he was “dead”. I spent the rest of the day in a daze,  confused about what had happened and replaying the moments over and over in my head. The ‘what if’ questions kept popping up each time the sick feeling in my stomach went away even for a minute or two. 3:14pm We finally heard that my dad was going to be ok, that he had had an anaphylactic reaction to one of the allergy shots.  He was clinically dead for 3 minutes but the nurses revived him and the EMTs kept him stable. Many people told my sister and me that if it weren’t for us, my dad would be dead. Technically that is true, which was and still is very terrifying to think about. My dad’s life was never supposed to be in my dumb teenage hands but the other way around. 4:22 (Time you are reading this) Nov 11, 2022 Now I’ve had plenty of time to reflect on what happened those horrific minutes and the following hours and what I keep going back to is… What if my dad, my rock, my parent, my friend had died?  What if the last moments I had with him were the ones of me snapping at him and being rude just because I hate mornings? I’d like to think that if things had turned out differently, I wouldn’t have tortured myself with those thoughts and would have forgiven myself knowing how much I love my him.. But I know I am an overthinker-  I would never have forgotten it and would have been left with a lot of regrets. The most important lesson I take from this horrible experience is to never take the little things, people, or moments for granted. Every fun, silly, loving, sad, hurtful time is a time you will never get back. Every moment no matter how small it seems, it means to you or the other person is bigger than you might believe. If my dad had officially died that day, there would be time I would never get back with him or have with him  in the future. People can easily vanish from your life faster than you imagine. Now I’m not trying to give some scary warning, but just some advice to learn from me and this experience- be grateful for what you have and the people who love you and take care of you even when you don’t feel like it.  Why listen to me?  Because I lived it… minute by minute. 
But just as often, we find similarities, even universalities. Still today, in our own literature, we can find Dante’s Inferno, and the legends of King Arthur, repeated and echoed and told again and again by individuals, all unique in their own right and yet entirely, universally human. As that which defines us, stories are things which we cannot afford to lose. In an age and a society in which there are no more campfires, in which we live not among tribes or clans, but among neighbors with whom we never speak, and in which social media not only allows, and not only facilitates, but indeed enforces selective listening, we all have the potential to lose the stories which we ought to hear. In so doing, we may lose what makes us human. No where, and at no time, was this made more apparent to me than when I moved to Texas just before sixth grade. I had hitherto lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a very liberal city in a fairly liberal state in one of the most liberal regions of the country. I was although a kid, a very liberal kid, and identified as a Democrat, which I still do to this day. So did nearly everyone else I knew in Pittsburgh. Then I moved to Texas, and became a speck of blue in a sea of red. I learned quickly to hide my politics, as divulging them would lead to me having to fend off the entire lunch table, and could even threaten friendships. I had one friend at TMI, who, after three years of friendship, eventually found out I was a Democrat and said, “Oh. I don’t think we can be friends anymore.” But, to this day, we still are friends. We still are friends because I, a Democrat, who had come from a Democratic place, came to Texas and listened to the story of my Republican friend, and he, a Republican, living in a Republican place, had listened to my story. We didn’t agree with each other, but we saw past the politics, to the stories, and to the humans underneath. I was reminded once again of the importance of stories while I was in Germany, attending a public high school there. I had the honor and privilege of acting as a translator at a memorial service. The service dedicated a small memorial, not to an individual, but to a family. The descendants of this family were in attendance, but they were English, and this was Germany, and so I was called upon by the master of ceremonies, a good friend of mine, to help her create and deliver an English language version of her program. It was a great honor for me to be entrusted with the telling of this family’s story. As I understood from my experiences in Texas that stories are what make or break us, I told the story of this family as reverently and delicately as it was in my power to tell. I told a story of hopeful immigrants, of industrious workers, and of a loving family. I told a story of grocers, and of dentists. Yet ninety years ago, there were others who told a very different story about this same family. That story was told by angry men in power, and it went something like this: “They are traitors. They are evil. They are taking your freedom. They are taking your money. They want to tear your country apart; they want to tear your family apart; they want to tear you apart. They are not a family of grocers and dentists: they are our mortal enemies.” This story was told simply because the family was Jewish. And because tens of millions believed that story, I can no longer tell the story of this family without recounting how they were brutally beaten, arrested without charge, and denied medical treatment. This family fortunately survived. Millions of other families did not. The Holocaust shows the power of a bad story. Or, more accurately, the power of a bad story when people believe it. But why would people believe it? How could so many people believe such a ludicrous story? Because it was convenient. Because it empowered them, it made them feel good about themselves, it was financially beneficial to them, and it explained all their problems away. It was the most convenient thing for them to believe. The price of that convenience was the deaths of eighteen million Jews, Slavs, Romani, and countless others who were deemed undesirable. The price of convenience was humanity.Certainly, we are all inherently human beings. But to be human, to be humane, is not a passive state of being; it is an active endeavour. It requires effort to be human. The truth requires effort, understanding requires effort, and human connection requires effort. We all must do our best to break out of our echo chambers, to immerse ourselves in different, even opposing, perspectives, and to heed the horse’s story from the horse’s mouth. We will sometimes fail in these endeavours, and it is unfortunate that we will fail, but it would be intolerable if we failed to try. Our stories make us what we are; we can not afford to neglect them-- any of them. When we cease to tell them, and when we cease to listen to them, we become less than ourselves.
TMI, we are a collection of human beings, all individually unique, and yet entirely, universally human. We each must participate in the defining act of humanity. We must share our stories, and ensure that we listen to the stories of others, especially to the stories of those most unlike ourselves. Humanity is indeed a force for good in this world, but only if we who comprise humanity live up to what it means to be human.
This makes me feel a sense of joy. As the week of VBS progressed and I went back to the church, I was able to return to my role as recreation leader, and I was also able to see the excitement that the kids had while they were singing, dancing, and playing. To see the happiness in the children’s faces, it made me feel so joyful to know that others were having such a great time in my happy place. There was this one little six year old girl, named Callie, who was always so quiet whenever she was getting dropped off by her parents, but as soon as she entered through those double doors, her face would always light up because she was just so excited to be in a place where she knew she was going to have an amazing time. Callie’s joy will always be the reminder that I need to know that this is my place.  Callie was attending a Vacation Bible School in Poteet, Texas, yet her smile was as big as if she was about to ride Space Mountain at Disney. What I’m trying to say here is that while I was away from my church community, I started to miss it, even though I was in a place that was supposed to be the happiest place on earth.  And it made me reflect.  I thought “What if I never got to go back?” “ Am I taking my church family for granted?”  “What if I don’t ever get to feel the joy that I feel in that place with those people?” The presence of happiness, joy, and excitement can be anywhere, even in this very chapel, it doesn’t have to be in a beach in the caribbean, and this is when I realized that you don't have to go all the way to disney to be in the greatest place on earth because the greatest place on earth is the place where the spirit of God comes alive in you. And it made me commit to not taking things for granted. I hope that by now you have thought of the place that you feel the happiest, the place that you feel the safest, the place that you never want to leave from, and I hope that you learn to appreciate it more because there could be a day where you never go back. There could be a day that your happy place is changed into something else, and there could be a day where we don’t wake up that morning to experience happiness at our favorite place.  There’s a famous saying, which says that “Tomorrow is not promised”. However, God calls us to seize the day and live each day like it’s our last.  In the Bible, Psalm 118:24 says that “This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it”. Remember that tomorrow is not promised, it isn’t guaranteed that we will live to see another day so we should live each day like it’s our last. I hope we can learn to take advantage of the days we are given.  We don’t need to go to Disney to find the peace we seek. A content and happy heart is closer than we think, in fact it’s usually right in front of us or literally within us.  Today I’ll be more appreciative of the blessings God has given me and I invite you to do the same.  Thank you. Where is home? Do you mean “Where have you lived the longest?”, “Where were you born?”,  or “Where did you live before here?”, because all of those questions have extremely different answers. Being military, my family always joked that we had no answer when somebody asks us where we’re from. When I was 10 years old, that was supposed to change after my dad left Army Active Duty. We could finally have some permanence an hour's drive from Frankfurt, Germany in a picturesque, hilltop village called Melkerei. My mom was livid when we learned about our drastic move to Europe. My dad had, once again, failed to consult the family whenever it came to relocation. The move was quite rocky at first. Upon our arrival, the US government placed us in temporary housing. It was the hottest summer on record, and we found ourselves on the third floor of a multi-family house without air-conditioning. My sister and I would frequently drag our pillows and blankets from the loft bedroom to sleep on the cooler living room tile floor. Within the first 9 months of our arrival, we had bought and renovated a concrete block home within walking distance to the Nanstein Castle. I chose my bedroom, the location of my skylight, and positioned my newly purchased German bed against the sloped walls and under the opened skylight window. Although, occasionally, I would forget to close the window during the thunderstorms and would return to a sopping wet mattress.
