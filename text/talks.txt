I am an optimist. I like to look on the bright side of things whenever I can. Whenever I am down I reset my thoughts by saying “it is what it is” and look for solutions. Now, this last year tended to be a very “It is what it is” kind of year, but I found that that is the exact thing I needed to say. With little control over our current situation I tried to make the best of the worst conditions. I worked to have fun and enjoy my junior year and make it my best year yet. And with my new attitude and new friends I had the time of my life. To give you an idea of what was upcoming for me I will give you the general overview. I was going to C dorm as the prefect that year. For me, C was like a Found family comedy like Friends or How I Met your Mother in which the cast would always get into some sort of crazy scenario and end up closer because of it. Because of this I will set the cast and stage so you can see from my point of view. Coming with me were two sophomores (Ryan and Flint), another junior (Matthew), and our one senior, (Joey) who was in C dorm previous years.  We all lived in C and it was one of the older dorms that had lots of faults that weren’t present in the new dorms. But no matter its faults and issues, C dorm made up for it in character and memories. Now that you have the general overview, let's begin. Despite having to go through quarantine before, I did not realize the extent to which quarantine meant in the dorms. Although I and the other Junior Matthew had cars, we were not allowed to leave at all. In fact, visits outside of our dorm became much more of a hassle because each house was declared its own “unit” and had to stick with their own. Now I am not saying that these rules were unjust, but they did make everything more - difficult. To start, our food situation wasn’t ideal. We would have food dropped off in our common room for us for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and the only constant was the poor quality food. We had the saddest chicken for breakfast and lunch most every day with equally awful dinners. But we knew that the quality wouldn’t change on its own so we took up the challenge to fix it. Armed with a hot plate and a simple Chef’s Knife, our master chef Flint would take control of the kitchen. At first it started by recooking the pork in the pork tacos and adding spices and other toppings, but it soon evolved to his specialty Chicken Sandwich. He would sear the chicken with a hot plate to give it a solid crust and he would make his own cane’s sauce. Combined with some toasted bread and smuggled vegetables, we are left with a pleasant sandwich.  We would do this for nearly every meal that we could fix as even though we couldn’t do much, we did what we could with what we were dealt. But not every meal could be fixed. Enter the enchiladas verdes. Although ideas popped up about a potential solution, we realized that some things can’t be fixed. And although nothing could directly fix it, we had prepared for this as we knew that somethings must start anew. Beforehand we went to the store and bought some steak, spinach, and other ingredients for our meal. With our three New York Strips in the freezer and hot plate on, with supervision, we started our feast. Accompanied by the delicate comedy of Southpark and by each other, we were happy. It didn’t matter that we were stuck or why we were stuck, we were happy. This “it is what it is” outlook soon spread to every aspect of our lives. We realized that we may not have had our conventional resources, but we had what we had. We had a group of very different people with various backgrounds and personalities and a Computer and occasional trips to target. So we did what we could with what we had. After classes in online school, we would often go out to the hall and stretch so then we could sit down and watch Southpark or some trash show on the History network. When we had classes together we would go outside and sit with one another. No more Friday movie trips? No problem! We set up our own movie night watching all sorts of movies like Parasite and Bruno. We then added game night playing Dark Souls, Smash Bros., and Undertale. We then ventured into horror games like Dead Space 3 and DDLC. This then led to each of us leading our own journeys. Joey would bring us deep into the Chinese version of Youtube being our tour guide to all the inside jokes. Matthew would lead us on our dorm repair with his janky ideas of “fixed” like paper shadings for hallway lights and a shower curtain as a doorway. The aforementioned Flint would contrast my optimism with his pessimism, cook, and show us his favorite absurdist Australian comedians. And Ryan would sit in his room and do Math homework. Meanwhile I was there watching it all and “supervising” where needed and egging on when I saw the opportunities for a stable level of chaos. Hair cuts? Well we got a $40 razer from Target and five boys giving their ideas of what looks “right”. No more going out for events? Well we have two full water bottles, cardboard boxes, and a hallway so we made a crude one on one bowling game. Every problem we faced we kept our chin up and figured out a solution or workaround. However, there is one problem I couldn’t fix. One Catastrophe that we can’t wait out. The Freeze. Through the night the snow gathered and gathered, and when we awoke it was piled up to amounts TMI hadn’t seen for some time. We had the privilege to see TMI under all that snow and it was amazing. My dorm all ventured out into the snow and we went as far as the lacrosse field. Although I complained of the temperature and my fingers freezing off for the whole time
Throughout my life, I have been given many different names. These include “little Kyle”, “the youngest Kyle”, “the last of the Kyles”, “the baby of the family”. I have even been called “pipsqueak”, a name first given to me by my aunt, but then so lovingly adopted by my oldest brother, more based on the fact that I am the shortest out of my siblings than the youngest, but a name that I have been referred to as nonetheless. The majority of my life has been based on my three older siblings. I have gone to the same schools as them, taken the same classes, played the same sports, and tried all of the same hobbies. This led me to being a very annoying little sister, which I have unfortunately always been aware of thanks to one of my brothers. For the most part though, my siblings have been very accepting of my constant desire to tag along and ask incessant questions, even when seeking their acceptance has led to major regret and quite a bit of crying. As a kid I would get scared very easily. That’s not to say that I don't anymore, but it is not nearly as bad as having nightmares about the movies Jaws and Gremlins for months after watching them. My sister was forced to deal with my constant paranoia before falling asleep every night during those periods considering we shared a bedroom for the majority of my life. However, I was always convinced that I would be able to make it through the same scary things as the rest of my family. Hence why when my parents brought up the idea of going to the haunted house, "The Nightmare on Elm Street," I attempted to convince everyone else of my bravery. Keep in mind, I was eight. There was no sign that I would be able to successfully make it through a haunted house. I could barely even handle playing "Call of Duty'' because I got startled by other players coming around a corner in front of me. Despite this, I had far too much faith in myself. My siblings knew better. They remembered my fear more clearly than I had, but I insisted that this time it would somehow be different. I am still unsure why anyone thought to even consider letting four children into a haunted house like that. Given that there are at least ratings on movies,
I was 13 years old when my father decided to walk out of my life. If I am being honest, he had left my family long before he physically walked out the door. You learn quickly when bad things like this happen, it is either learn to cope or decide to cave. When my father left I think I did both. Facing the music of my reality, there was a lot of crying and letting little things get to me. Luckily, I like roller coasters so this ride of emotion called “cold reality” was starting to hit home. In today’s world, “coping” is an often used buzzword but I don’t think most of us grasp the true meaning of “coping.”  For those who don’t know what coping is let me give you the dictionary definition:   “to deal effectively with something difficult.” True coping requires more than just “dealing” with it, you need to do it effectively and it became clear pretty quickly I didn’t understand that part of it. ​To “cope” with his leaving I turned to video games and sleeping. When I played games it took me to a different world, a world where I did not have to deal with the thoughts and feelings I had about my situation at hand. However, because of this, my grades reflected this unhealthy coping method. My grades were dropping and the mask I put on at school was starting to slip off. Sadly I didn’t make any changes and my future is affected because of my inability to realize that I was not really coping. Yes, video games are fun and made me feel better, but all it was doing was keeping me occupied until I turned the video games off and those thoughts and feelings I thought I was handling reared their ugly head again. It became clear I was only escaping what I needed to face. Another mechanism I thought was coping was just avoiding anything that had to do with my father. It seemed easier than trying to explain our strange and new family dynamic.  As terrible as it seemed for this to happen 3 days before Thanksgiving, I was kind of thankful it surrounded a holiday because I didn’t have to see anyone. I didn’t have to explain I wasn’t with my parents or why my mom was so sad or why I didn’t want to get out of bed.   Even now, anytime I have a conversation with him as the topic I get physically uncomfortable and I feel sick. I am a work in progress. Healthy coping is when there is a positive outcome and you have positive relationships. I put on a facade so I wouldn’t have to talk about it, to anyone. As it turns out, that wasn’t coping, that was avoidance.  I was struggling in school; I wasn’t progressing in the Corps; and I was separating myself from my friends.  Then we had a Pandemic.  Each of us has a “Covid” story.  Covid was in some way a great outlet for me because it allowed me to further isolate.  School as we knew it ended.  The world shut down but no one understood my world had already closed its borders.  School finally “resumed” virtually but Zoom classes were not my friend.  It turns out, even an introvert needs people. It was still easier for me to hide. I did not excel.  
Life is like a beast, always moving, changing, and growing, but it will devour you if you don’t keep up with it. An interpretation of Charles Darwin once said, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.” Let me say that again, it is not the strongest or smartest who survive, but those who can adapt.  We all have this in common, at some point we will all have to face adversity in some form or another. In this interpretation, survivors don’t power through it or outthink it, they adapt to it to win.  We all wish there was some way to hit the pause button on life and maybe even a cheat code around the hardest parts, but they don’t exist. There is no way to stop life from going forward, no matter what someone may go through, we as people need to be able to adapt to survive. As you can probably guess, lacrosse has taught me a lot about life. If you do not know, lacrosse is a full-contact sport that requires you to drive through the defenders to get a goal.  Sometimes you dodge, sometimes you dive, and most times you get hit.  Everyone who has played lacrosse with me knows that I am know
Oftentimes, I believe myself to be one of the unluckiest people on Earth. While this isn’t uncommon for your average teenager, I happen to have this feeling quite frequently. As a control freak, I keep my grip on reality by attempting to limit negative outcomes while maximizing positive ones. To me, the idea of something being entirely out of my control is unnerving and frustrating. Unfortunately, no one can control everything because life inherently involves luck and chance. Often, I feel as if I always pull the short straw, and as I’ve grown, my own circumstances have continued to make life an increasingly risky game. But if given the opportunity to gain complete control over my life, I wouldn’t take it because over the past seven years, my life’s unlucky and uncontrollable situations have undoubtedly shaped me into a better person. If you don’t know me personally, I have a very tragic talent for being extremely clumsy. For me, the seemingly simple act of walking often leads to bruises and scratches. As an athlete, clumsiness-- along with a strong competitive nature-- opens up a multitude of opportunities for broken bones, twisted ankles, and pulled muscles. (As you can see right here with my broken wrist so being on this stage with stairs right in front of me is extremely scary). Since the fifth grade, I haven’t gone a year without at least one injury. Clearly, this is a bit unlucky, right? At first, I thought so too. In my book, however, those were the lucky injuries. Those were the ones I could always bounce back from. On the other hand, my unluckiest and most consistent talent, which basically defines my entire athletic career, is my unnatural and surprising ability to get a concussion in any given situation. As ridiculous as this sounds, I seriously do have an uncanny talent for getting concussions. In any contact sport, concussions are a given risk, but with girls' soccer having the second-highest concussion rate among high school sports (UPMC), my chances of getting a concussion are significantly higher. With already bad odds, I always took extra precautions to avoid injury by wearing ugly, bulky headgear: like this concussion headband (show concussion headband). Whether heading a soccer ball, hitting the ground, or even someone else’s head, this headband is supposed to provide a certain level of protection for common areas of impact. However, in my very unfortunate case, this headband provides little protection, as more often than not, soccer balls slam directly into my face instead of the headband. (Let me illustrate this phenomenon for you.) Unfortunately, even outside of soccer, my odds are not much better. Oftentimes, by simply existing, I am prone to concussions. By the end of my eighth-grade year at TMI, I had sustained multiple concussions from several activities including soccer, basketball, and surprisingly, science challenge. With my reputation and my own little gravitational force field surrounding my head, I was basically an urban legend under the constant threat of flying objects. However, there’s one occasion, which occurred on our end-of-the-year field trip, that really proves the enormity of my unluckiness. Though my memory is slightly vague, I remember my entire eighth-grade class had been on a basketball court at Mo Ranch. On one side, I was talking to a group of my friends, and on the opposite side, a group was playing with my soccer ball. Suddenly, I heard my name being called, and as I turned around, I felt the sting of my own soccer ball colliding with my face and immediately collapsed (and a huge thank you to Andy Cubriel because that was one of the funniest ways to conclude TMI middle school). Looking back at this moment, neither I or my friends know how this is statistically possible. 
I distinctly remember waking up to the sound of my alarm blaring to an all too familiar sound. I slammed the top of the alarm as I had every morning before, but I knew this morning was different. Up until that moment the true reality of what I had gotten myself into had not truly settled in, the days and months leading up to me coming to TMI had seemed more like preparation for a summer camp than moving into a boarding school, but in that moment staring at my ceiling as my roommate stirred across the room, everything suddenly hit me at once. The only thing left in my mind was the thought, “I messed up really bad this time”.  School had been one of the places I despised most in the world, and now I had gotten myself stuck living there for the rest of the year. The strenuous series of events that ended up with me standing here today all started 2 years before I first came to TMI. I had lived most of my life on the northside of Houston in The Woodlands and in my mind this was the place that I thought would always be my home. I had imagined my friends and I all going to the same high school and graduating together, but none of this was meant to be. One night at dinner my parents asked me how I felt about moving, and not realizing the seriousness of the question, I agreed that living in a new city could be interesting and not much more discussion of the subject was brought up. I went on with my life like normal, thinking nothing of the conversation until a couple months later it was brought up again, but this time it was not a question. I was told that my dad was going to be switching jobs and that we would be moving to Corpus Christi after the school year ended in a few months. As many kids would hearing this news I did not take it well. I hated the idea of leaving my home and my friends. From my stubbornness and anger the idea began to form that I would simply just not leave. 
It is my opinion that any chapel talk that hopes to stick into the tiktok length attention span of the average TMI students brain, needs to clearly state what it's about very early on in the talk while all the listeners are still awake.To put it bluntly I want to talk about time, specifically how we handle it with our habits and how making tiny changes now can change the trajectory of your whole life. Now, the genesis of this talk is a TMI 2015 convocation day video, which was in fact the first glimpse I had into TMI life before I was a student, and it got me thinking about time. Every single person in that video, with the exception of some of our ancient faculty and staff, is no longer ats TMI .when that video was filmed however they were just students at TMI, same as me and you however the main difference between them and you currently is that their time as a highschool school student, is over, its finished for them, but for you, its not, you still have time left here, whether that be years or 77 days exactly including today. regardless, you will never again in your life be this young and It's easy to look at this statement as very depressing and sad. Rather look at it like this, never again will you have this much opportunity or potential to change the course of your life, now At the core of any good time travel movie a key point will be how any little shift or change in the past can have huge repercussions for the present. Makes logical sense right, now take out the time travel sci fi nonsense, and apply it to right now. Any action or decision you make right now in your life could have immense effects on what happens in the future and so many people fail to consider that. The best time to change your life was yesterday, and the second best is today.
“All in”, I announced, as an over-hyped me pushed my dignity along with every single one of my chips into the center of the poker table. I stared right into Chris Goldsbury’s clear blue eyes as I shoved everything into the pot, hoping to catch the slightest glimpse of stress or uncertainty in his face gained from my calling his bet. To my horror, he just aimed his usual friendly smile back at me. It was only him and I left in the hand, and we had both put it all on the line. It was the final hand of the night, and I had chosen to leave my fate in the hands of luck. Lucky for me, I had been having no shortage of it that night. Just five minutes prior to going all in, I was balling. I felt like I had luck on my side and was on top of the world as I had been winning so much that I was ready to cash in my chips and go buy both Boardwalk and Park Place. It was around 11:55 PM when I asked the house, Carlo Miggins, to cash out. To which he replied, “just wait five more minutes.” I sat back down at the table and, feeling lucky as I was, allowed my friends to coax me into playing another hand. Chris played the hand with unmatched confidence and aggression, despite usually being a conservative and restrained player, causing everybody besides me to fold their cards. He knew his hand had a high value, as he bet more and more money every chance got, with a smug goal of forcing me to match his bet to extract maximum dollars from my wallet. I had a solid hand and was already in too deep by the time Chris went all in. It came down to just the two of us, and Chris had caught me in a flustered state. He realized that the last thing I wanted to do was fold my cards and let my winnings as well as my ego take a hit on the last hand of the night, so he exploited me in my state of delirium. I briefly contemplated folding my cards as I would only be losing about a quarter of my money instead of risking it all, especially when I knew all signs pointed to his hand being stronger than mine. Despite this, I dropped my poker face, allowed my pride to take the wheel, and let any remaining sense of reason fade into the void I call “Yolo” as I reached for all the rest of my chips to match his colossal bet. I was caught dead in the heat of the moment as the whole room gathered around our table, bringing the volume and the pressure to an all-time high. The most humble and sportsmanlike smile crept across Chris’s face as he turned over the winning hand, taunting me back into the depths of my own mind and my now empty wallet. I had lost everything, all in one hand, because of one decision. Similar to poker, life can be a game of luck. There are times when you can make all the right moves and things can still go wrong, and it’s times like these that cause players to stray from their logic. But, in the long run, if you learn to keep your head on your shoulders and continually make the right moves under the right mindset, it can pay off in both games as your odds of winning will be maximized. Although we do not have control over the cards we are dealt, we have constant control over how we let our “luck” affect us mentally. In order to achieve a winning mindset, you have to find your poker face: a mental zone where you allow nothing and no one to phase your outlook on the game. To hold your poker face is to fortify your mind by using your logic to find the best possible outlook.
