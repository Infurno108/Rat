I am an optimist. I like to look on the bright side of things whenever I can. Whenever I am down I reset my thoughts by saying “it is what it is” and look for solutions. Now, this last year tended to be a very “It is what it is” kind of year, but I found that that is the exact thing I needed to say. With little control over our current situation I tried to make the best of the worst conditions. I worked to have fun and enjoy my junior year and make it my best year yet. And with my new attitude and new friends I had the time of my life. To give you an idea of what was upcoming for me I will give you the general overview. I was going to C dorm as the prefect that year. For me, C was like a Found family comedy like Friends or How I Met your Mother in which the cast would always get into some sort of crazy scenario and end up closer because of it. Because of this I will set the cast and stage so you can see from my point of view. Coming with me were two sophomores (Ryan and Flint), another junior (Matthew), and our one senior, (Joey) who was in C dorm previous years.  We all lived in C and it was one of the older dorms that had lots of faults that weren’t present in the new dorms. But no matter its faults and issues, C dorm made up for it in character and memories. Now that you have the general overview, let's begin. Despite having to go through quarantine before, I did not realize the extent to which quarantine meant in the dorms. Although I and the other Junior Matthew had cars, we were not allowed to leave at all. In fact, visits outside of our dorm became much more of a hassle because each house was declared its own “unit” and had to stick with their own. Now I am not saying that these rules were unjust, but they did make everything more - difficult. To start, our food situation wasn’t ideal. We would have food dropped off in our common room for us for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and the only constant was the poor quality food. We had the saddest chicken for breakfast and lunch most every day with equally awful dinners. But we knew that the quality wouldn’t change on its own so we took up the challenge to fix it. Armed with a hot plate and a simple Chef’s Knife, our master chef Flint would take control of the kitchen. At first it started by recooking the pork in the pork tacos and adding spices and other toppings, but it soon evolved to his specialty Chicken Sandwich. He would sear the chicken with a hot plate to give it a solid crust and he would make his own cane’s sauce. Combined with some toasted bread and smuggled vegetables, we are left with a pleasant sandwich.  We would do this for nearly every meal that we could fix as even though we couldn’t do much, we did what we could with what we were dealt. But not every meal could be fixed. Enter the enchiladas verdes. Although ideas popped up about a potential solution, we realized that some things can’t be fixed. And although nothing could directly fix it, we had prepared for this as we knew that somethings must start anew. Beforehand we went to the store and bought some steak, spinach, and other ingredients for our meal. With our three New York Strips in the freezer and hot plate on, with supervision, we started our feast. Accompanied by the delicate comedy of Southpark and by each other, we were happy. It didn’t matter that we were stuck or why we were stuck, we were happy. This “it is what it is” outlook soon spread to every aspect of our lives. We realized that we may not have had our conventional resources, but we had what we had. We had a group of very different people with various backgrounds and personalities and a Computer and occasional trips to target. So we did what we could with what we had. After classes in online school, we would often go out to the hall and stretch so then we could sit down and watch Southpark or some trash show on the History network. When we had classes together we would go outside and sit with one another. No more Friday movie trips? No problem! We set up our own movie night watching all sorts of movies like Parasite and Bruno. We then added game night playing Dark Souls, Smash Bros., and Undertale. We then ventured into horror games like Dead Space 3 and DDLC. This then led to each of us leading our own journeys. Joey would bring us deep into the Chinese version of Youtube being our tour guide to all the inside jokes. Matthew would lead us on our dorm repair with his janky ideas of “fixed” like paper shadings for hallway lights and a shower curtain as a doorway. The aforementioned Flint would contrast my optimism with his pessimism, cook, and show us his favorite absurdist Australian comedians. And Ryan would sit in his room and do Math homework. Meanwhile I was there watching it all and “supervising” where needed and egging on when I saw the opportunities for a stable level of chaos. Hair cuts? Well we got a $40 razer from Target and five boys giving their ideas of what looks “right”. No more going out for events? Well we have two full water bottles, cardboard boxes, and a hallway so we made a crude one on one bowling game. Every problem we faced we kept our chin up and figured out a solution or workaround. However, there is one problem I couldn’t fix. One Catastrophe that we can’t wait out. The Freeze. Through the night the snow gathered and gathered, and when we awoke it was piled up to amounts TMI hadn’t seen for some time. We had the privilege to see TMI under all that snow and it was amazing. My dorm all ventured out into the snow and we went as far as the lacrosse field. Although I complained of the temperature and my fingers freezing off for the whole time, I enjoyed it and thought it would be another memory dedicated to C Dorm. But when we got back, everything got worse. Our power went out and the temperature started going down. The apartment was below freezing and the common room was about 45 degrees. Although the option of going to a newer dorm was presented, we stuck together and bundled up in the common room watching a show on a laptop, weathering the storm. Spirits were still high despite the fact that temperature was low. We were dealing with our problems as well as we could while keeping a positive outlook but then everything came falling down, literally. We soon got told to evacuate the building as a portion of one of the other old dorms had collapsed along with the ceramics building due to freezing pipes and water troubles. But no matter the issue, we had to get out. All I could take was my backpack with my laptop and a few sets of clothes. We evacuated to Ewing, one of the relatively newer dorms, and set down our stuff. Once we settled in and calmed down, we were ready to assess our situation. Suddenly, a pipe burst right outside our room in the hallway. I grabbed my bags once more as water was filling the room and moved to Abbot this time. To say my optimism was still at 100% would be lying. I was on the verge of freaking out, keeping my composure just till I was alone. But to my surprise, Flint, our local pessimist, was doing what I couldn't. He remembered our backup steak that we had marinating in the C Freezer and started cooking it outside. He knew that everything was finally going the pessimistic route where nothing went right, but he made the best of the situation. He was standing outside in the below freezing weather and handing out pieces of our rainy day meal to whoever needed it. And then I realized how important this mindset is. Maybe Flint was just coping in his own way and doing what he was good at and enjoyed, but more to my point he knew what would make anything better. He acted in a way that improved all of our situations even if it wasn’t much. He did what he could and that is more than I can say for myself. With the snow melting and being able to return to my home in South Texas I had time to think about the situation. Time passed and I returned to Abbot after Spring break. With Ewing fixed, the Ewing kids could go back to their dorm, but the same could not be said for C dorm. My precious dorm was unsalvageable with water problems being found in the main dorm and more urgent water concerns in Dr. Leport’s apartment. Of course I was devastated but I knew that nothing could be done to save the building. I saw that we had the same people and the same opportunities for goofing off but still it was hard to lose such an important figure for us. As of my last quarter of Junior year, I am still in Abbot. We have grieved and are forced to face that it is what it is. My dorm is now an empty lot and some of us even got to observe it’s demolition. Our community had moved to Abbot but it wasn’t the same and nothing we could do would make it the same. We had caught lightning in a bottle and now it was gone. We still honor the dorm with each of us taking our own keepsakes of C dorm. I claimed a non working clock with algebra instead of numbers and a fire alarm. Others took photos and their own piece of the building. I even printed some vinyl stickers that say “mini C” to put on our dorm. Despite all this, we have recovered what we could. We aren’t the same group, but when Dr. Leport comes for dinner, we all sit around as a Dorm once again to chat and banter. We started to pick ourselves up again and returned to our mindset of “it is what it is” and started doing what we could to stay together. We go get fastfood and tailgate. We eat together during lunch and during all of our outings. There is still a bond that can’t be broken by a freeze. Now after all of this sorrow I recognize how important that attitude is. We could have gotten brought down by the pandemic and everyone that goes with it, the boredom, the loneliness, the sameness of everything, but we lasted. Our attitude of gratitude kept us upbeat and led to some of the best memories I have ever had. Poker nights while watching every single Twilight movie and the stupid mind games that came with it. Playing with the VR and cracking jokes while someone was cutting bullets in slow mo. Our showing of Parasite got too popular and had to be interrupted because too many of the other dormers were watching with us instead of going to community night. Even the times when I would have to climb a window or crouch down in a too small shower feel nostalgic because of my attitude. No matter the problem, our attitude made it better. We said “it is what it is” and got through everything and forged a bond that will last and be remembered. Whenever you face hardships, think back to what you can do to make your situation better. And if you need a starting point, I will tell you of the knowledge passed on to me by Joey, our oldest and wisest roommate. Putting dinosaur stickers on everything makes the world a bit better. Thank You.  
Throughout my life, I have been given many different names. These include “little Kyle”, “the youngest Kyle”, “the last of the Kyles”, “the baby of the family”. I have even been called “pipsqueak”, a name first given to me by my aunt, but then so lovingly adopted by my oldest brother, more based on the fact that I am the shortest out of my siblings than the youngest, but a name that I have been referred to as nonetheless. The majority of my life has been based on my three older siblings. I have gone to the same schools as them, taken the same classes, played the same sports, and tried all of the same hobbies. This led me to being a very annoying little sister, which I have unfortunately always been aware of thanks to one of my brothers. For the most part though, my siblings have been very accepting of my constant desire to tag along and ask incessant questions, even when seeking their acceptance has led to major regret and quite a bit of crying. As a kid I would get scared very easily. That’s not to say that I don't anymore, but it is not nearly as bad as having nightmares about the movies Jaws and Gremlins for months after watching them. My sister was forced to deal with my constant paranoia before falling asleep every night during those periods considering we shared a bedroom for the majority of my life. However, I was always convinced that I would be able to make it through the same scary things as the rest of my family. Hence why when my parents brought up the idea of going to the haunted house, "The Nightmare on Elm Street," I attempted to convince everyone else of my bravery. Keep in mind, I was eight. There was no sign that I would be able to successfully make it through a haunted house. I could barely even handle playing "Call of Duty'' because I got startled by other players coming around a corner in front of me. Despite this, I had far too much faith in myself. My siblings knew better. They remembered my fear more clearly than I had, but I insisted that this time it would somehow be different. I am still unsure why anyone thought to even consider letting four children into a haunted house like that. Given that there are at least ratings on movies, I would have expected some sort of age limit, preferably one that was higher than eight. For some reason though, my parents caved in and bought the tickets. It was possibly thanks to what I would like to call my “youngest child charm,” also known as annoying my entire family and begging until my parents said okay. Throughout the time leading up to our trip, I continued to convince myself of how brave I was going to be. I rehearsed methods of how to get past each room involving remembering that each of the monsters was just a regular person determined to make their customers feel immensely uncomfortable, a truly wonderful job description. I had no idea what to expect from this experience though because the closest that I had come to a haunted house was the Phineas and Ferb Halloween special where they build a giant haunted house to cure Isabella’s hiccups. Needless to say, my expectations for how scary it would be were very low. There was no need to think about all of the times that I had failed to watch a semi-scary movie without covering my eyes or plugging my ears at certain points. Those were all two dimensional as well, which is completely different from an in-person experience that would definitely not be more immersive, and realistic, and terrifying. The point is that I am almost certain that I had subconsciously blocked any movie that gave me nightmares as a kid from my memory so as to convince myself that I would be prepared for what was to come. On the day that we were supposed to finally go to “The Nightmare on Elm Street” I was excited to be able to prove myself to my siblings. They could no longer make fun of me for getting frightened far too easily because I would have endured the same terrors as they had. But when the site of the attraction came into view, my confidence began to dwindle. From what I remember, the building towered over the crowds of people waiting in lines to meet their doom. Every crack and chip in the rickety, old home was illuminated by an ominous, red glow. The entrance was clouded by a thick fog, and as we moved closer I could hear the eerie music grow louder and louder in my ears along with my quickened heartbeat.  While we joined the line to venture inside, the building loomed before me. It threatened my new reputation that I was building. I could not let a measly haunted house take me down, so I stood as tall as my eight year old frame would allow and plastered a smile onto my face. As we approached the entrance, the realization of my mistake flooded into my head. My siblings knew better.
I was 13 years old when my father decided to walk out of my life. If I am being honest, he had left my family long before he physically walked out the door. You learn quickly when bad things like this happen, it is either learn to cope or decide to cave. When my father left I think I did both. Facing the music of my reality, there was a lot of crying and letting little things get to me. Luckily, I like roller coasters so this ride of emotion called “cold reality” was starting to hit home. In today’s world, “coping” is an often used buzzword but I don’t think most of us grasp the true meaning of “coping.”  For those who don’t know what coping is let me give you the dictionary definition:   “to deal effectively with something difficult.” True coping requires more than just “dealing” with it, you need to do it effectively and it became clear pretty quickly I didn’t understand that part of it. ​To “cope” with his leaving I turned to video games and sleeping. When I played games it took me to a different world, a world where I did not have to deal with the thoughts and feelings I had about my situation at hand. However, because of this, my grades reflected this unhealthy coping method. My grades were dropping and the mask I put on at school was starting to slip off. Sadly I didn’t make any changes and my future is affected because of my inability to realize that I was not really coping. Yes, video games are fun and made me feel better, but all it was doing was keeping me occupied until I turned the video games off and those thoughts and feelings I thought I was handling reared their ugly head again. It became clear I was only escaping what I needed to face. Another mechanism I thought was coping was just avoiding anything that had to do with my father. It seemed easier than trying to explain our strange and new family dynamic.  As terrible as it seemed for this to happen 3 days before Thanksgiving, I was kind of thankful it surrounded a holiday because I didn’t have to see anyone. I didn’t have to explain I wasn’t with my parents or why my mom was so sad or why I didn’t want to get out of bed.   Even now, anytime I have a conversation with him as the topic I get physically uncomfortable and I feel sick. I am a work in progress. Healthy coping is when there is a positive outcome and you have positive relationships. I put on a facade so I wouldn’t have to talk about it, to anyone. As it turns out, that wasn’t coping, that was avoidance.  I was struggling in school; I wasn’t progressing in the Corps; and I was separating myself from my friends.  Then we had a Pandemic.  Each of us has a “Covid” story.  Covid was in some way a great outlet for me because it allowed me to further isolate.  School as we knew it ended.  The world shut down but no one understood my world had already closed its borders.  School finally “resumed” virtually but Zoom classes were not my friend.  It turns out, even an introvert needs people. It was still easier for me to hide. I did not excel.  
Life is like a beast, always moving, changing, and growing, but it will devour you if you don’t keep up with it. An interpretation of Charles Darwin once said, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.” Let me say that again, it is not the strongest or smartest who survive, but those who can adapt.  We all have this in common, at some point we will all have to face adversity in some form or another. In this interpretation, survivors don’t power through it or outthink it, they adapt to it to win.  We all wish there was some way to hit the pause button on life and maybe even a cheat code around the hardest parts, but they don’t exist. There is no way to stop life from going forward, no matter what someone may go through, we as people need to be able to adapt to survive. As you can probably guess, lacrosse has taught me a lot about life. If you do not know, lacrosse is a full-contact sport that requires you to drive through the defenders to get a goal.  Sometimes you dodge, sometimes you dive, and most times you get hit.  Everyone who has played lacrosse with me knows that I am known for getting hit. Hit pretty hard in fact. So hard, they gave me a nickname: Gumby. That name is not because I get hit hard though.  It’s because no matter how hard, I still get up. I do this because what is the point of staying on the ground? If I have not suffered a severe injury, why stay down? Either way, the game will go on without me and I am not helping my team if they are worried. I must be flexible toward the situation and get up. Not only will this show that I can go back into play, but it will let my teammates know that I am okay. More than that, with every hit I learn something about my competitor. While every hit will be different, each one teaches me how to adapt to their defense, their style of play, and their athletic ability. Much like life,  lacrosse will have hits that come quickly and out of nowhere. The only way to bounce back is to get up and keep playing the game. Learn from each “hit” and adapt your game, your strategy, and your life to win. I have not only learned adaptability from being hit (and, of course getting back up) on the lacrosse field, but I have also learned the importance of adaptability from times when we were losing. A great example of this is when TMI Lacrosse played against Reagan last season.  You may not know this, but last year they were a division ahead of us and favored to win. In the first half of the first quarter, they were able to score four clean goals on us. We were playing awfully. Not only could we not clear the ball, but we couldn’t even hold it on offense if we tried. The whole team was making mistakes, myself included. It was getting to the point where it would be hard to come back. I called a timeout so we could figure out what we were doing wrong, slow the game down, and find their weaknesses. The team and I took a breath and came together to see what we had learned. With this, our team was able to adapt to the circumstances.  We could adapt to the situation and overcome the problems that people had. How did that work for us?  Right off the bat, we were able to score a goal. Then on Reagan’s next offensive possession, we were able to stop them from scoring. We adapted to their style of play and got back up from that big 4 goal “hit.” This adaptation gave us what we needed to go on a non-stop scoring spree. We won that game… by a lot! When situations are looking rough the only way to fix them is to slow down, observe your surroundings, and then act upon them and adapt. Even when I was young I had to learn how to adapt.
Oftentimes, I believe myself to be one of the unluckiest people on Earth. While this isn’t uncommon for your average teenager, I happen to have this feeling quite frequently. As a control freak, I keep my grip on reality by attempting to limit negative outcomes while maximizing positive ones. To me, the idea of something being entirely out of my control is unnerving and frustrating. Unfortunately, no one can control everything because life inherently involves luck and chance. Often, I feel as if I always pull the short straw, and as I’ve grown, my own circumstances have continued to make life an increasingly risky game. But if given the opportunity to gain complete control over my life, I wouldn’t take it because over the past seven years, my life’s unlucky and uncontrollable situations have undoubtedly shaped me into a better person. If you don’t know me personally, I have a very tragic talent for being extremely clumsy. For me, the seemingly simple act of walking often leads to bruises and scratches. As an athlete, clumsiness-- along with a strong competitive nature-- opens up a multitude of opportunities for broken bones, twisted ankles, and pulled muscles. (As you can see right here with my broken wrist so being on this stage with stairs right in front of me is extremely scary). Since the fifth grade, I haven’t gone a year without at least one injury. Clearly, this is a bit unlucky, right? At first, I thought so too. In my book, however, those were the lucky injuries. Those were the ones I could always bounce back from. On the other hand, my unluckiest and most consistent talent, which basically defines my entire athletic career, is my unnatural and surprising ability to get a concussion in any given situation. As ridiculous as this sounds, I seriously do have an uncanny talent for getting concussions. In any contact sport, concussions are a given risk, but with girls' soccer having the second-highest concussion rate among high school sports (UPMC), my chances of getting a concussion are significantly higher. With already bad odds, I always took extra precautions to avoid injury by wearing ugly, bulky headgear: like this concussion headband (show concussion headband). Whether heading a soccer ball, hitting the ground, or even someone else’s head, this headband is supposed to provide a certain level of protection for common areas of impact. However, in my very unfortunate case, this headband provides little protection, as more often than not, soccer balls slam directly into my face instead of the headband. (Let me illustrate this phenomenon for you.) Unfortunately, even outside of soccer, my odds are not much better. Oftentimes, by simply existing, I am prone to concussions. By the end of my eighth-grade year at TMI, I had sustained multiple concussions from several activities including soccer, basketball, and surprisingly, science challenge. With my reputation and my own little gravitational force field surrounding my head, I was basically an urban legend under the constant threat of flying objects. However, there’s one occasion, which occurred on our end-of-the-year field trip, that really proves the enormity of my unluckiness. Though my memory is slightly vague, I remember my entire eighth-grade class had been on a basketball court at Mo Ranch. On one side, I was talking to a group of my friends, and on the opposite side, a group was playing with my soccer ball. Suddenly, I heard my name being called, and as I turned around, I felt the sting of my own soccer ball colliding with my face and immediately collapsed (and a huge thank you to Andy Cubriel because that was one of the funniest ways to conclude TMI middle school). Looking back at this moment, neither I or my friends know how this is statistically possible. 
I distinctly remember waking up to the sound of my alarm blaring to an all too familiar sound. I slammed the top of the alarm as I had every morning before, but I knew this morning was different. Up until that moment the true reality of what I had gotten myself into had not truly settled in, the days and months leading up to me coming to TMI had seemed more like preparation for a summer camp than moving into a boarding school, but in that moment staring at my ceiling as my roommate stirred across the room, everything suddenly hit me at once. The only thing left in my mind was the thought, “I messed up really bad this time”.  School had been one of the places I despised most in the world, and now I had gotten myself stuck living there for the rest of the year. The strenuous series of events that ended up with me standing here today all started 2 years before I first came to TMI. I had lived most of my life on the northside of Houston in The Woodlands and in my mind this was the place that I thought would always be my home. I had imagined my friends and I all going to the same high school and graduating together, but none of this was meant to be. One night at dinner my parents asked me how I felt about moving, and not realizing the seriousness of the question, I agreed that living in a new city could be interesting and not much more discussion of the subject was brought up. I went on with my life like normal, thinking nothing of the conversation until a couple months later it was brought up again, but this time it was not a question. I was told that my dad was going to be switching jobs and that we would be moving to Corpus Christi after the school year ended in a few months. As many kids would hearing this news I did not take it well. I hated the idea of leaving my home and my friends. From my stubbornness and anger the idea began to form that I would simply just not leave. 
It is my opinion that any chapel talk that hopes to stick into the tiktok length attention span of the average TMI students brain, needs to clearly state what it's about very early on in the talk while all the listeners are still awake.To put it bluntly I want to talk about time, specifically how we handle it with our habits and how making tiny changes now can change the trajectory of your whole life. Now, the genesis of this talk is a TMI 2015 convocation day video, which was in fact the first glimpse I had into TMI life before I was a student, and it got me thinking about time. Every single person in that video, with the exception of some of our ancient faculty and staff, is no longer ats TMI .when that video was filmed however they were just students at TMI, same as me and you however the main difference between them and you currently is that their time as a highschool school student, is over, its finished for them, but for you, its not, you still have time left here, whether that be years or 77 days exactly including today. regardless, you will never again in your life be this young and It's easy to look at this statement as very depressing and sad. Rather look at it like this, never again will you have this much opportunity or potential to change the course of your life, now At the core of any good time travel movie a key point will be how any little shift or change in the past can have huge repercussions for the present. Makes logical sense right, now take out the time travel sci fi nonsense, and apply it to right now. Any action or decision you make right now in your life could have immense effects on what happens in the future and so many people fail to consider that. The best time to change your life was yesterday, and the second best is today. To quote the Roman poet horace “Dare to be wise; begin! He who postpones the hour of living rightly is like the rustic who waits for the river to run out before he crosses.” but you don’t just magically change because you want to. If you truly want to change in the most effective way possible you have to understand how little changes in our habits now completely change your future.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable or even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more. habits seem to make little difference now and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes obvious. We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much at the moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of shape. We make a few changes, but the results don’t come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn't move much. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss. But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem. The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving fromLAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.*Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant at the moment, but over the span of a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to endwell. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every month,then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you're moving slower than you’d like.Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound years down the line. Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self. Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad Habits make time your enemy. Habits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up. Imagine that you have a pot of water on a hot plate in front of you, you heat the water up until it scalds you, but nothing happens so you keep heating it up and heating it up, but it's not until you heat it from 211 degrees fahrenheit to 212 degrees fahrenheit that something actually happens, the water begins to boil A one-degree shift,seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. However, even if you try maintaining good habits it can be so easy to give up on them because you don't see results. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,weeks, and even months.
Every day from kindergarten to 8th grade, we would have a daily chapel to begin every school day. These chapel days would be led by the school’s headmaster, Mr. Webster. Mr. Webster is not only one of the best speakers I have ever heard, not only one of the best role models ever, but he is one of the best people I have ever met. He is the example of a perfect, loving person. Mr. Webster, also known as El Guapo, is a tall man who loves wearing his suits with blue jeans. He is someone who made an impact on everyone. Ask anyone who knows him, and they will say how much they love him. Even when I went to my sister’s chapel talk back in 2015, I was asked many times by TMI faculty about Mr. Webster. Everyone knows him because he just is so great. Everyday during chapel, he would show a clip of a movie, and then he would talk about a life lesson that was shown in that movie. He would talk about laziness or how to use our values to bring up a better life for ourselves. There are infinitely many quotes he had that are beautiful, however, my favorite one is “Let love and honesty rule your life. Take those words love and honesty and write them on the tablet of your heart. And you will win a good name, and a good name is worth more than all the money in the world.” This wonderful saying was spoken almost every day by Mr. Webster. What he meant by “name” is someone’s reputation or character. Someone’s reputation is more than their wealth, where they go to school, their job, or anything else. A person’s character defines who they are better than anything else. Think about some of the best historical figures in the world. Think about five of the best people in history. You probably thought of people like Gandhi, MLK, Muhammad Ali, Abraham Lincoln, or even Albert Einstein. All that mattered was their character. No one thinks of the wealthiest people in history when talking about the best people. I doubt anyone thought of Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. Which proves that someone’s name is better than everything else. People would much rather prefer someone who can create a positive impact on the world rather than someone who does not. I strive to have a good reputation, and I bet most people listening would agree that my reputation is definitely not the worst, but definitely not the best. I can do better and so can most. People in this room would want to be remembered after they leave TMI. The best way to do that is to take the words love and honesty and write them on the tablet of your heart. As I reflect on the people who gave me love and honesty, I think of when I was a 10 years old always being at the mosque during the month of Ramadan. I always would hang out with my brother’s friends, so everyone would be a lot older than me. Some people were in their 20s and they seemed like old men to me. I was the youngest in that group by far. All of the older teens and 20 year olds would always treat me like the baby in the group and would be super kind. Everytime we would play basketball, they made it easy for me to score and even picked me up for me to dunk. Everytime we would eat dinner, they would make sure I had food first even though most of the time, they would fast while I was too young to. They always did the best they could to make me feel included. They treated me with respect even though I was just a tiny baby to them. One person who comes to mind when thinking about people with a great name is one of my favorite teachers I have ever had, Mrs. Duke. 
Hi, Kifak Ça Va? In English, this sentence translates to Hi, How Are You? Are you fine? What you don't realize, however, is that each word in this phrase is in a different language. It’s three different languages combined together to form one whole, singular statement. It is a combination of English, Arabic, and French. Mixing three languages may sound pretty complicated to you, but it is fairly routine for me. I value this complexity because it is a good representation of how I grew up and how I live my life. Contrary to popular belief, my last name is neither Arabic nor French; it is actually Armenian. Some of you may know this, but the majority do not know that I am trilingual. Not only that, but I have been since I was five years old. Growing up in a house that primarily spoke Arabic and French, those languages came to me naturally. Altering every word, creating new words, and switching to different languages in one sentence is commonplace in my household. My mom and dad were both born in Lebanon, a small country located in the Middle East. My mom is fully Lebanese, and my father is half French and half Armenian. Growing up in Lebanon, French and Arabic were their first two languages, so there was no doubt that their two children would eventually learn them too. They both came here as young adults, and although adjustment was difficult, they seemed totally fine with their dichotomous world: American outside the house and something different at home. They appeared at ease with different foods, different music, and even different humor, matching their surroundings at any moment. They had friends that were like them and other, more traditional Americans, for lack of better words. Early in my life, I never realized this complexity. It was perfectly normal for me to watch Spongebob and Sesame Street in English while simultaneously speaking in Arabic or French to my mother. At times, I would also watch cartoons or acrobats on the French satellite channel TV5. And to be quite honest, I thought this is what everyone else did too. I was in, what I would call, an ethnic enclave. It was the same for my brother. I enjoyed my Lebanese and French dishes cooked by my mom while also occasionally enjoying a hot dog, a burger, or mac and cheese. I didn’t have much American influence at home, but I never felt out of place. I never seemed to question who and where I was and how I got here. As I started school, things got more complicated. I slowly started realizing that most people I met did not have families similar to mine. For most, English was the only language with the occasional Spanish speaker. No one seemed to have the complex culinary experience I had had. I began to ask myself: “How did I get here?” when I would talk to my parents about our family history. I could not comprehend how a French-Lebanese girl ended up in San Antonio, Texas as a native-born American citizen. I quickly learned that I wasn't like the people next to me, and at such a young age, that did nothing but make me question myself and my interests. Growing up is hard. We never talk about it ourselves, but we all know it. We are constantly overthinking and over-stressing about every situation, whether good, bad or somewhere in between. In short, our minds are all over the place. However, the one constant in growing up is wanting to blend in. This was no different for me. At such a young age, it was hard for me to understand the dynamics of the world, and I could never understand why I felt this way. I was confused about how I felt so in place at home but never did when I was at school. As I started first grade, I would bring my pink, polka-dotted, embroidered backpack set to school with me just like any other seven-year-old girl. I would place it in the cubby with my name on it, again, just like everyone else; I felt connected as, on the surface, it looked like I had the same things as the kids around me. I loved my backpack set. I would get excited over the vibrant colors and the keychains that I would adorn it with. However, the key part of the set was the lunch box. Every day, before school, my mom and I would pack my food in a Thermos. I loved my Lebanese food and would always choose it over anything else offered to me. Something to know about Lebanese food is that it's got a lot of spice and, quite frankly, can look a bit Martian at times, but to me, that didn’t matter because that is what I loved. Glancing over at my friends’ lunches, it looked like a whole collection of American staple dishes
In the words of the great Kenny Rogers, You gotta know when to hold 'em, and you gotta know when to fold 'em. Life is a mental game - it's about how you choose to play the cards you're given.
“All in”, I announced, as an over-hyped me pushed my dignity along with every single one of my chips into the center of the poker table. I stared right into Chris Goldsbury’s clear blue eyes as I shoved everything into the pot, hoping to catch the slightest glimpse of stress or uncertainty in his face gained from my calling his bet. To my horror, he just aimed his usual friendly smile back at me. It was only him and I left in the hand, and we had both put it all on the line. It was the final hand of the night, and I had chosen to leave my fate in the hands of luck. Lucky for me, I had been having no shortage of it that night. Just five minutes prior to going all in, I was balling. I felt like I had luck on my side and was on top of the world as I had been winning so much that I was ready to cash in my chips and go buy both Boardwalk and Park Place. It was around 11:55 PM when I asked the house, Carlo Miggins, to cash out. To which he replied, “just wait five more minutes.” I sat back down at the table and, feeling lucky as I was, allowed my friends to coax me into playing another hand. Chris played the hand with unmatched confidence and aggression, despite usually being a conservative and restrained player, causing everybody besides me to fold their cards. He knew his hand had a high value, as he bet more and more money every chance got, with a smug goal of forcing me to match his bet to extract maximum dollars from my wallet. I had a solid hand and was already in too deep by the time Chris went all in. It came down to just the two of us, and Chris had caught me in a flustered state. He realized that the last thing I wanted to do was fold my cards and let my winnings as well as my ego take a hit on the last hand of the night, so he exploited me in my state of delirium. I briefly contemplated folding my cards as I would only be losing about a quarter of my money instead of risking it all, especially when I knew all signs pointed to his hand being stronger than mine. Despite this, I dropped my poker face, allowed my pride to take the wheel, and let any remaining sense of reason fade into the void I call “Yolo” as I reached for all the rest of my chips to match his colossal bet. I was caught dead in the heat of the moment as the whole room gathered around our table, bringing the volume and the pressure to an all-time high. The most humble and sportsmanlike smile crept across Chris’s face as he turned over the winning hand, taunting me back into the depths of my own mind and my now empty wallet. I had lost everything, all in one hand, because of one decision. Similar to poker, life can be a game of luck. There are times when you can make all the right moves and things can still go wrong, and it’s times like these that cause players to stray from their logic. But, in the long run, if you learn to keep your head on your shoulders and continually make the right moves under the right mindset, it can pay off in both games as your odds of winning will be maximized. Although we do not have control over the cards we are dealt, we have constant control over how we let our “luck” affect us mentally. In order to achieve a winning mindset, you have to find your poker face: a mental zone where you allow nothing and no one to phase your outlook on the game. To hold your poker face is to fortify your mind by using your logic to find the best possible outlook. To drop your poker face is to betray yourself by giving out free information to your opponents as well as giving up your mental leverage. Your mind is your most powerful weapon, as it is the only thing that stays within your control in any given situation. The moment you let your poker face slip and allow yourself to act under the influence of your own emotions is the moment that your rationality leaves you and your odds become one hundred percent a gamble. One impulsive decision can sting you in the short term, but one small adjustment to your mindset can last a lifetime. That night as I lay broke on Carlo's couch, I thought about the large change in my wallet and the root of it.
I was never a perfect student, I got A’s on occasion but I was mostly a B student which meant I was average, mediocre, and unremarkable. My academics were not particularly noteworthy or impressive. I would go to school and constantly look for distractions to get me out of class. I would talk with my friends, ask to go to the restroom, or even enjoy the occasional fire drill just to skip that little bit of class. Distractions gave me the ability to forget that I was just an average student. As a result of my lack of focus and dedication to my studies, I often found myself behind in class becoming below average. I would struggle to keep up with the material, and my grades would suffer as a result. I would try to make up for it by studying harder and putting in more effort, but it was always an uphill battle. I was never able to fully catch up, and I would always end up feeling lost, frustrated, and discouraged, but then we hit this one unit in science class - life cycles. This topic caught my interest and made me think. For the first time, I found myself looking forward to going to class. I was fascinated by the way that different organisms developed and changed over time. This was the only class that I ever wanted to take, the only class I felt motivated to do better in. … Step 1 Airway must be secured with intubation. 7th grade came and I walk into science class expecting to pick up exactly where we left off learning about life and the many living things on earth and how they interacted with each other. All I wanted was to learn more about what makes up life and how we move but instead, I was greeted with rocks. Not even diamonds or emeralds just plain old rocks! I felt robbed, cheated, and empty. I had finally found something I was interested in and it was stripped away from me faster than a TV on black Friday. I was frustrated and upset leading me to fall back into my normal routine of looking for any distraction that came to me.  That was until my 6th-grade teacher Mrs. Mayberry offered an elective course I was able to find that passion again and study what I wanted. … Step 2 Mark the incision sites. In 8th grade, I got to experience the wonders of Forces, Motion, and Energy it never came close to life sciences but I enjoyed it. Once again I had found myself far away from the class that brought me the most joy and interest but at least it was learning about something that captured my attention. Step 3 create Incision into the epidermis. In 9th grade, I found my mind exploring the medical field and the many different pathways it has to offer. I expressed my interest to multiple different family members and I was assured that I had the ability to move forward in it. I was told that I must improve my grades to reflect good academic rigor so I did. …Step 4 Go through the dermis and superficial fascia! 10th Grade came and after a successful summer at a medical exploration camp, I was finally certain of the path that I wanted to take. I took the extra time to make sure I showed dedication in my classes. Instead of focusing on the closest distractions, I was finally beginning to find ways to not be distracted by focusing on achieving the goals that I wanted for myself. This quickly became the motivation needed to further my progress on what felt to be my impossible dream. … Step 5 Dissect through the muscle. 
"Why am I doing this?" That was a question I had in mind ever since middle school. Korea’s education system makes everyone fixate on grades and getting into those top 3 colleges, resulting in the craze of after school academies trapping students often past midnight every single day. During my time in Korea, where I spent most of my life, I didn’t know the purpose of me as a person. I felt like I was just wasting my time doing homework, for just some quiz, and a rank that didn't mean much. Summer of 2019, I decided, I needed a break from this cycle. My parents and I decided to look into studying abroad, which was always in the back of my father’s mind. When we found TMI, we fell in love. It was a small private school, away from the city, surrounded by nature. As I was looking for something completely different from my experience in Korea, it was perfect. Stereotypical statement from immigrants, but for me, America really was the land of opportunities. It was a second chance in life where I was given a blank canvas and was able to make that painting whatever I wanted it to be. However, this new painting I had to do was very far from home, and very far from what I was used to. Living by myself, alone in the dorms was probably the biggest change other than the language & cultural barrier I experienced. I didn’t have my parents to tell me what to do. I was ecstatic at first, indulging myself with snacks, ramen, and laying in bed with dirty clothes and shoes on. Those are some things I would never be able to do at home. However, living in the dorms came with responsibilities that I didn’t realize at first. Now, everything was up to me, and with too much freedom given to me, I was a wreck. The first two months flew by, and covid hit. Had to come back home for a while, and 6 months later I was on the flight back to Texas to start my sophomore year. This time, it was online though. All of us in the C dorm weren't allowed to leave the building, and I was bored out of my mind. Since I didn’t have much work to do, all I did was online shopping, watching random movies, and just killing time. I had everything I wanted from when I was in Korea. But soon enough, I was becoming a couch potato, as lazy as I can be. Laundry started to pile up, garbage was overflowing, unopened amazon packages stacked up against a corner, and my grades were going down. One of those days, I was in the shower, after watching South park for the past 3 hours, and procrastinating on math homework. I started thinking. Even though I thought life was better than before, I was doing the same thing I was doing in Korea: wasting away my time. My drawing on the blank canvas started to look like the one I had in Korea. I was devastated when I realized that I was going back to my old self. I wanted to be better, and I knew I could if I actually tried. That night, I made myself a promise. I need to be better than who I was the day before.  In my head, a new question popped up. “What can I do to make myself better?” Self improvement became my life motto from that point on. The next day, I shaved my head, determined to change myself. I wanted to move on from my past, and be a whole new person. It all started from a shower thought. I started to identify my flaws and pointed out two of them: discipline and health. The thing I struggled the most with was discipline, especially time management. I would always give up, sit on my phone and just waste time, when I got bored or tired. That led to assignments and chores piling up. If anyone remembers Paul's chapel talk from last year, he said “Ryan was always doing math in his room.” I was. Kind of.  Half the time, I was watching stupid tiktoks. Other half, I was sitting at my desk, zoning out.  Procrastination is a scary thing.  By the end of that quarter, I had 17 missing assignments for math due in 3 days. It was a nightmare. I started to take time management more seriously. I figured improving my productivity would help. I started by fixing my sleep schedule, by strictly going to bed at 10, waking up at 6:45 even on weekends. 
It was another sunny spring day in my fifth grade year, and I was rushing to finish my breakfast because I did not want to cause my family to be late. We were on our way to St. PJ’s Children’s Home to participate in a volunteer project. I was very excited because we had never been to St. PJ’s before, and I had been told that there was a basketball court for me to play on with my friends after the project was over. After a quick 30 minute drive, we arrived at the orphanage, and I jumped out of the car to greet all of my friends. We worked for about half of the day cleaning bedrooms, sweeping kitchen floors, organizing bookshelves, and various other chores that would help the staff and residents. After the cleaning came the part I had really been looking forward to: playing. Some people went to play board games. Some people went to the arts and crafts area, and my friends and I went outside to play basketball. We split up into two teams–each team was a mix of kids from the volunteer group and kids who lived in the orphanage. The game lasted about thirty minutes, after which we all went inside to feast on the various snacks and juices provided to us. The volunteer project described above was fairly routine to me as volunteer work has been an important part of who I am for my entire life. Both of my parents came from humble beginnings, and they completely uprooted their lives for my brother and me. They came to this country with nothing to their name, and even after their decades of hard work to reach the place they are now, they continued to stress the importance of giving back to the less fortunate. My parents believed that their children should see the value of helping other human beings for no other reason than just to help. Therefore, my brother and I have been attending monthly volunteer projects since before we could remember. One of my earliest memories includes standing on top of an empty banana crate just so that I could reach over the table to help hand out bread at Haven for Hope, a homeless shelter in San Antonio. Although I have helped out at these projects since I was a young child, I never truly understood the importance of what I was doing. I simply saw the projects as a fun way to spend my Saturday afternoon with my family. However, that changed after the St. PJs' project.
I love my parents. I have been blessed with parents that love me unconditionally and are able to provide for me. They’ve worked so hard to give me a better life than they experienced when they were young. A better life of living, better education, and a lot of love. They were very determined and through all their perseverance made it in America. My mom was born on December 3rd, 1967 She grew up in Baghdad, Iraq. When my mom was growing up she was relatively safe. She lived with her grandma, grandpa, uncles, and aunts for most of her life in one house. She didn’t have privacy or her own room since she lived in a crowded house. Her dad wasn’t in her life. The time she saw her dad was at age 6. Her dad was always a busy man. He’d been working in Saudi Arabia for 9 years trying to make good money. When living in that house my mom was trained from an early age to learn how to clean and cook. She couldn’t play outside unless there was a guardian watching her whilst having a curfew. When going to school she had to walk to each of her schools from elementary to high school. The schooling system had a mix of boys and girls this was up until 7th grade; when the schools separated the boys and the girls into their own different schools. Her dad came back and builds a house and opens up a business for her future at age 13. My mom was enrolling in high school when Iraq and Iran went to war. The war itself lasted from 1980-1988 but the devastation my mom went through was terrifying. Constant alarming air raid sirens, electricity cutting in and out sometimes for days with no electricity, drinking water depleting, and sometimes they had no food at all. She would hide under trees since there were no bunkers outside to hide under. She would even go on top of rooftops and watch the bombers do a run-by bombing power plants. Even through all of this struggle my mom still went to high school a 10-minute walk in the heat of the danger. She’d eventually graduate from high school and get her driver’s license now at the age of 17. 1985 She would be put into an arranged marriage meeting my dad and marrying him and fleeing the country all around the age of 17. This led to a brand new chapter in my mom’s life. My dad had a very different childhood from my mom. He was born on May 2nd, 1956 but due to a mix-up of papers, he was automatically given a default birthday of July 1, 1957. He lived in a house that was made up of mud and wood. He shared the roof of the house with his mom, dad, two sisters, and two brothers. Their house had no individual rooms. They slept all on the floor. He lived by mountains in a rural area. He had no electricity, no gas, and there weren’t any cars only horses and donkeys. The village consisted of 15 families all were Christians. When my dad was around the age of 6, Iraq was in a war with the Kurdish the first of many wars with the Kurdish. This war would go from 1961-1970. One day my dad woke up and began his day as normal eating breakfast, and getting ready to start work, around noon he heard flying. He went outside and saw it was an Iraqi bomber plane, soon his entire village is engulfed with bombs. The Iraqi government thought the village was harboring Kurdish people. Even though the Kurdish wanted to take his village. Eventually, he and his family made it out of there and walked to a nearby village 2 hours away. They crossed mountains and eventually made it to the village. But, his sister who was 1 at the time had passed away. They just lost their house and a family member, at age 6 my dad became a refugee. They had to bury her in the village, they put a wooden cross as her gravestone. Over time they would leave the village and have their eyes set on settling down in Baghdad. They lived in better housing conditions, there was electricity and gas. His parents had another 5 kids, 1 girl, and the rest boys. They eventually owned a grocery store. They had my dad in school but my dad didn’t love school. My dad would fall in love with soccer and would purposely skip school to play soccer. When his parents found out they were angry and he dropped out of school in 3rd grade. Years later he fled Iraq at the age of 15 and moved to Lebanon so he could avoid being drafted into the Iraqi army. He left Iraq without anyone. When living in Lebanon he became a painter painting house interiors. Making enough to survive. He makes friends to keep him company. But then the conflict between Muslims and Christians lead to an all-out war. 
“I am smart. I am smart. I am smart” I repeat to myself over and over again. It is my mantra. It is what has always defined me. My intelligence. My wit. My entire sense of self worth has come from the validation I have received by being told that I am smart, I didn’t even have to work for it. I just was.
I am one of 6 kids, growing up everything felt like a competition. Who was the best behaved? Who helped the most around the house? Who was the best at mario party? Who was the best at singing? It all felt like one massive triathlon, with the grand prize being attention. I quickly ruled myself out of most of those competitions, but the one thing I decided I could stand my ground in was the smart competition, so I chose that one to focus my energy on. I didn’t care that I wasn’t the most athletic in my family, or the funniest, or that I wasn’t the best at singing. I cared about the “who was the smartest” competition. I made the right choice. I got all the praise and affirmation I could ever need because of this. Ever since I was little, I was in the gifted program; I always had the most A.R. points; I always had the best grades. The adults around me went crazy, fawning and preening over the little “genius” they had in their midst. The constant praise I got from the adults in my life, for doing what was for me the bare minimum, became my everything. They told me the info that came to me naturally and that my love of reading made me different from all the rest. That I was worthy because of my intelligence and it consumed me. Even as young as elementary school, grades were what I cared about. I would compare the grades on different assignments with the other kids in my class, and because I was always on top there I moved on the the next rung of the ladder: the other kids in the gifted and talented program. I was placed there because I did well on a test. A test I took at 5 years old determined where I was in comparison to other students. A single test, that determined my courses at that school, told me that I was better than the other kids, that I was smart. I thought tests were awesome after that; they were the repeated affirmation that I was smart. As I got older, the other kids caught up. I came to realize that I wasn’t smarter than them, or at least not to the degree I had previously believed. There are many other kids who were able to get straight A’s. There was always the nagging voice in the back of my head though, telling me I needed to be just slightly smarter than them. It was a new competition, with more, stronger players. I believe it was around there, around 5th grade that my grades, the score of how smart I am, the score of my value as a person, became an obsession. I was always told my grades were the key to my future. My parents are immigrants. Education. Is. Everything. I needed good grades to get into a good high school. And I needed good grades at that good high school to go to a good college. And I would, of course, need good grades at that good college to have a good future.These kind of thoughts fed into my frenzy. The stakes of my game have gotten higher. I checked my grades obsessively, to verify that I was, in fact, still smart, to the point that I was staring at them at least 7 times a day. I wouldn’t want to fall behind now, would I? Being placed in a regular level class, when honors was an option, was unacceptable. I don’t know why others couldn’t see that as clearly as I did. I continued throughout middle school that way, and high school came in a blur. In high school, in addition to being smart, I decided to try my hand at being a model student. I took the hardest classes I could get my hands on. All APs please. I also did as many extracurriculars as possible. 3 sports a year, plus so many clubs, that honestly I don’t even think I remember them all well enough to rattle them off. There would be days where I would be here, at TMI, for over 14 hours, 6 am to 8:30 pm. I quite literally lived here. I mean I was here more than I was at my house. On top of that I was having to do all my homework for the classes I chose to take once I got home. Afterall, I couldn’t have any teacher thinking of me as anything less than a perfect student, and a late assignment would most definitely qualify as being less than perfect. It. was. Exhausting. I was drained. For months at a time I would just do school, collapse, and repeat. I didn’t have energy to talk to my friends. I didn’t have energy for my family. Any moment I had free I used to rest. I got myself through it by saying it’s all for college. The extracurriculars were all for the resume. The grueling classwork was all so I had the grades to get scholarships for wherever I needed. I didn’t care about the decline of my mental and physical health, there was all a point to it…
“Not all that COUNTS can be COUNTED, -and not all that can be COUNTED, -COUNTS” Originally I had Two chapel talks, and Fr. Ben said “You only have ONE talk” so I had to make it count. I’m Going to tell you a couple of stories that have taught me what really counts. Picture this. - It's the first day of high school and I am brand new to TMI. I have my new uniform on, with some fresh khaki shorts and I am nervous yet excited to see what TMI is all about. My parents dropped me off at the flag circle and I headed into the gym for a meet and greet for new families and students. Once I got inside I saw countless new faces talking to each other and I felt overwhelmed. There were free breakfast tacos, - so naturally, I grabbed two. I ate one and stashed the other in my pocket. Then I walked outside of Frost and stood under the MacArthur statue where I met Sergio Ostos and Bryce Small. We talked for a bit and I felt like I had made some of my first friends at TMI. Eventually, the bell rang for chapel. So I go to drop off my stuff at my locker and as I put my backpack down I realize there's a stain all over my pants. - I left a loaded-up Bacon Egg and Cheese taco wrapped in foil in my pocket - leaving a huge grease stain. It looked like I peed my pants! I was so embarrassed. But I still had to carry on with my day. As I’m walking towards chapel I run into Evan Amsler, I didn’t know him well at the time but surprisingly that didn’t stop him from ignoring the obvious. - He could have taken the easy route by roasting me for my taco-stained pants. - - instead, this person, who later became a friend, chose the hard route. He looked past the ridiculous stain on my pants and met me with empathy and compassion. - The way I was treated in such a vulnerable position made my first impression of TMI stand out. I could tell This school was different. - and that COUNTS to me. TMI has done a great job of helping me see the powere seniors you too will look back and wonder where time has gone. So focus on making today matter.  Thank you, TMI for teaching me the meaning of what really counts. My life And the person I am has changed because of the lessons I have learned here. THIS COUNTS TO ME, AND I HOPE IT COUNTS TO YOU TOO. GOING TO TELL YOU A COUPLE OF STORIES OF WHAT I THINK COUNTS
Waking up to the sound of birds with the sun shining through the trees suddenly turns into the sound of construction and massive buildings blocking the light and casting a gloomy shadow into my room. The mountain I grew up on where you could drive for miles only seeing nature suddenly became driving through traffic with skyscrapers surrounding the view. For most of my life I grew up in Waynesville, North Carolina. It was a town where there wasn't much to go and do,  but there was a lot to see. The school I attended was small, and there wasn't much to do besides go to the youth center that would be open for kids after school. Having my friends live right around the corner, most of the time I spent with them was at the youth center or one of our houses. This all changed when I found out we would be moving out of Waynesville after I lived there for the past seven years. My family told my sisters and I we would be moving to the city of Charlotte, which was a very different environment that I was not used to. It was hard leaving the place I had grown up in for so long, but I was glad to be able to experience something new. Leaving the friends I grew up with and the place I called home wasn't easy in the slightest. Arriving in Charlotte, the first few months were hard getting used to the environment and making friends in the middle of the year, but over time adapting to this new life got a lot easier. There was a lot more to do and see. If I wanted to go see a movie in Waynesville, it was about a twenty minute drive. In Charlotte, it was five minutes away.  It was shocking with the variety of things you could do within a ten minute drive. I went to get hibachi for the first time there and ever since then I have gone every year for my birthday as a tradition. My sister having her fencing practices ten minutes away, for about a year everyday after school I would have to go with her and wait. Instead of doing my schoolwork, I would mainly mess around in the gym that they had. Over time I grew interested and eventually started going to practice with her. After the countless times I would trash talk her, I was quickly humbled after going a not so fair 0-15 against her. I still believe I was given a defective cord but it's ok, I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Over time I started traveling with my sister to the fencing tournaments, and after about two years of practicing and competitions we both qualified for nationals in 2013. Well…not really… The story I just told you was made up and fabricated to seem true. My life was not that simple growing up, but I wish it had been. I was the infamous military child, which to me I personally didn't know what the feeling of (home) meant. Instead (adapting) is the word that epitomizes the twelve years of my life before I moved to Texas. I have lived in two different countries, moved four different times and attended ten different schools. Going to school in Germany, it was hard communicating with classmates being the only kid that spoke English and little to no German. Moving schools was something I was just used to. I would move in the middle of the year.  Nothing was ever consistent. I did many different sports, but gymnastics was what I was planning to do in college. After a broken foot followed soon after by a long term back injury that was getting worse, I was forced to quit and move on from that dream. This talk was never to tell you a story of my upbringing or where I came from, this is about misperception. I could stand on this stage and say pretty much anything and make the background of my life believable to a lot of you. I am not the only person this week who has misrepresented their lives to you: whether on social media from an influencer you follow or somebody you know in everyday life.  What seems to be most important to people these days is what they see now, not the past, not the journey, now. We tend to look at the current moment, but usually don't focus on the rest. Every person in this room comes from a different background, and everyone has had a different path that has gotten them to where they are at now.  We tend to observe current information and use that as a basis to compare the position of others in retrospec
Picture yourself in your most restful state. Are you watching your favorite movie? Eating your favorite meal? Growing up, mine was anytime my head hit a pillow. This was partially because I was always growing, but it was mostly due to my busy schedule. Since 6th grade, my life revolved around beach volleyball. After long practices in the hot sand, taking a shower and getting into bed was the best feeling in the world. Though I frequently felt drained, I became accustomed to this routine: school, practice, sleep, repeat. I even transferred to online school freshman year to focus on training. This transition also gave me the time I needed to rest. As an introvert, I loved the ability to sit at home all day. I spent ninety percent of my time alone with only my parents and sisters to talk to. As time progressed, though, things shifted. A few months into online school, my family went through some changes. My sisters, mom and I moved out of our house and adapted to a new lifestyle. Initially, I responded poorly. I started making excuses for why I couldn’t go to practice or why I wasn’t turning in my work on time, because I could. I took advantage of the changes my family and I were going through. As a result, my passion for volleyball began to drift, and my overall motivation depleted. 
I spent day after day doing what I used to look forward to: resting with my head on a pillow. I didn’t realize how bad this was at the time, though. However, my mom used her mother's instinct and saw this much more apparently than I did. She informed our relatives of our situation, and my aunt drove down from Dallas despite her and my uncle’s upcoming plan: a hiking trip to Utah With both my mom and aunt having a mother’s instinct, they made an arrangement so my twin sister and I could join my aunt and uncle on this unexpected getaway. 
As I scanned through images of Zion National Park on my phone, I couldn’t help but have an ounce of dread as I imagined climbing rocks in the heat for days on end. I was at a place in which sleeping seemed the only suitable thing to do. But of course, I was excited and grateful for this trip. I was also full of anticipation. Having a mom who plans trips a year in advance, the spontaneity of it all was a completely new experience. Less than seventy-two hours later, I was on a plane to a place I had never heard of before. Seeming as though time wanted to test my patience, our flight was delayed three hours. In the meantime, my sister, aunt and I found a cozy spot on the floor. I spent some time on my phone, but I quickly got tired of repeatedly scrolling through social media. As I sat completely bored, I glanced over my shoulder to notice my aunt reading a thriller novel. Up until that point, I hadn’t considered myself a reader. I had tried reading here and there, but besides competing in Battle of the Books in second grade, I had never given it a real chance. I asked my aunt some questions about what she was reading, and, seeing my curiosity, she offered me a novel to read on her kindle. I was immediately sucked in. Before I knew it, it was time to board our final plane. We landed, met up with my uncle, hopped in the rental car, and headed towards Zion. Though I have seen mountains several times throughout my life, such as the ones in El Paso, I was in awe of this new landscape. Rocks of every shade of red and orange stretched as far as I could see. As the sun set, the colors became vibrant, and I couldn’t take enough pictures. Though I have raging car sickness, I felt completely calm. We eventually parked, headed to our hotel room, and recharged for our early morning. We woke to our alarm at four a.m.; We aimed to beat the heat for the majority of our first hike called  “Angels Landing”. I was not naturally a morning person. Waking up early felt like torture most days. However, I hopped out of bed much quicker this time. Though I was drowsy as I ate breakfast and changed clothes, there was a positive energy about the early morning. I immediately felt more productive. Back at home, I woke up no earlier than noon every day. I had created a lazy habit that not only made me feel gross but affected my work performance.   
I want everyone to think of a place where you feel the happiest, the safest, and the most comfortable. It might be your home because this is the place where you’re constantly at to sleep, eat, and just relax. Your bed is here, arguably the most comfortable thing in the house.  Your family is here, arguably your favorite people in your life.  Your pets are here, arguably your best friends in the world. Another place you might be thinking of is your favorite sport.  There’s the basketball court, football field, outside track, or baseball field and maybe this is the spot where you are constantly going to take your mind off things, the spot where you’re the most focused, or the spot where you’re the most energetic. And this might be the reason why you find yourself joyful, content, and safe while playing your sport. Have you ever had the opportunity to experience traveling to an exotic place? Maybe there’s a specific vacation destination spot that you feel the happiest in.  I think everyone here knows about one of the more magical places in the country, Disney World. Disney World is often deemed as being “The Happiest Place on Earth”, maybe because of the excitement people get from riding those roller coasters with all the loops, drops, twists and turns. Maybe it’s from the fact that people can take pictures with life size versions of their favorite Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, Cinderella, Darth Vader, or my personal favorite, Woody from Toy Story. Maybe it’s from the amazing different types of food you can try that’ll just give your stomach that perfect fulfillment after a long day of walking. Regardless of the reason people might like Disney World, my family loves going there because of the time we get to be away from our normal, everyday lives.  It’s a time where we can just go to a place that is so far away that we don’t have to worry about anything that is happening back at home. It’s a time where we can just be together, experiencing the wonders and creative works that Walt Disney had in mind when coming up with the theme park concept. It’s a time where my mom is able to force us to take countless pictures and videos so that she can save them and look back on the memories. It’s a time where we can also be forced into being “that family” with all the gray matching mickey mouse shirts that say “TAMEZ 2022 SUMMER VACATION”. Lastly, It’s a time where we can just reflect, smile, be joyful, and realize how blessed we are to have the means to be able to travel and enjoy the vacation. I’m betting you have a place that makes you feel the happiest such as playing a sport or going to Disney World to enjoy the rides and experience a burst of thrill and excitement.  My happiest place is somewhere you might find unusual. As much as I love family trips to Disney, and as much as I would love to spend time on a beach in an exotic country, the place that makes me feel the safest, the most comfortable, and the most joyful is in a small little town outside of San Antonio, which is known as the strawberry city of the United States, called Poteet, Texas. Now in Poteet, there are several little restaurants, shops, and outdoor food markets that makeup the city.  However, the place that sticks out to me is the small church that’s located right before you enter the main street, and this church is called RLC,or  Resurrected Life Church. RLC has been an established church for about six years now, and I have been attending this church since the day it was founded.  Throughout the years, we went through many trials and setbacks.  The church was forced to meet at three different building locations for four years before buying our own. We had to shut down because of Covid and our only solution was to have our service outside. Countless fundraisers were created in order to try and raise enough money to start construction. Troubling tasks were forced on us such as fixing AC units and broken pipes, and also having to spend many hours cutting the grass, sweeping the floors, and moving around construction materials.We didn’t have the financial capabilities that some other big churches had so we were stuck being the ones to come up with different ways to support the construction of our new Church building. However, through all of these tribulations and tough times, we continued to stay loyal and faithful to God in believing that he would take care of the church and this is exactly what happened. The church members and I never felt like it was a chore to clean and maintain the building because we knew that this Church would go on to positively impact and touch so many lives.  We were blessed with anonymous donations that would help us buy materials to keep the church building going.  The progress that was made in construction over the last year has been incredible, but like I said, this progress wasn’t done by professionals, most of the work that had been done to the building was from the people that attended our church. From putting up sheetrock and painting the walls, to installing light fixtures and doors, and even setting up all the TV’s, computers, and sound systems, the members of the church and I made our mark on the building. The reason why I find this church building to be my second home and to be so special to me is because everytime I enter through those doors it reminds me of all the hours we put in to complete the building, it reminds me of the teamwork, grit, and determination that was shown by everyone, and it reminds me of the fact that all the people in the church came together for one common goal, which was to build up God’s vision for us. Like I mentioned before, my family has been going to Disney World in Orlando, Florida for a couple years now and every year it’s an amazing trip. However, this past summer’s trip to Disney felt a little bit different.  At RLC, we were finally going to be hosting our very own summer camp called Vacation Bible School. During VBS, kids from all ages are able to come to our church for a week of games, food, dancing, singing, and overall learning more about God while also forming a relationship with Him. The only problem was that VBS was going to start the same week that my family was still going to be out of town, and because of this, I was going to be forced to miss the planning, setting up, and first day of the camp. Normally this wouldn’t be a big deal, except for this year, I was asked to be the recreational leader for the camp, which meant I would lead the games and do different activities for the kids. While I was away, I couldn't stop thinking about what was happening back at the church, how close they were to finishing the decorating, and I couldn’t stop thinking about how excited the kids would be on the first day. I started to realize how I missed being at the church.  I missed walking through those double doors and feeling a sense of comfort, I missed being able to greet the new visitors as they came to our church, and I missed being in the presence of God. I missed my second home. Despite physically being at Disney World, my heart was in Poteet, Texas As much as Disney and Poteet might seem like opposite places, they really do have more in common than you might think.  Disney World, which is supposed to be “the happiest place on earth”, and my small, little church in that small, little town aren’t that different. Disney World has kids running around in excitement because they get to see Mickey Mouse, but the church has people running around in excitement because they get to have a conversation with God through prayer.  Disney World is a place where people feel safe because they have so much fun, but church is a place where people feel safe because they know God is there with them. Disney World brings people together from different cultures, backgrounds, and ethnicities, but the church also accepts anyone and brings people together from different ways of life.  The idea of Disney World was thought up by Walt Disney, a man filled with creativity and new ideas, but the church was thought up by God, a God filled with love and prosperity. When I came back from our family vacation, I had an urgency to be back at the church building, an urgency to see my church family again, an urgency to be a volunteer and give back, and an urgency to be back in the place where I feel the most connected with the presence of God.  The church shows people love and it gives people hope. When facing tough times and going through daily struggles, God is there waiting for you.  He is always listening and willing to help us out.  This makes me feel a sense of comfort.  God is constantly looking out for us and making ways for us to be successful.  This makes me feel a sense of safety.  God is doing miracles behind the scenes.  This makes me feel a sense of joy. As the week of VBS progressed and I went back to the church, I was able to return to my role as recreation leader, and I was also able to see the excitement that the kids had while they were singing, dancing, and playing. To see the happiness in the children’s faces, it made me feel so joyful to know that others were having such a great time in my happy place. There was this one little six year old girl, named Callie, who was always so quiet whenever she was getting dropped off by her parents, but as soon as she entered through those double doors, her face would always light up because she was just so excited to be in a place where she knew she was going to have an amazing time. Callie’s joy will always be the reminder that I need to know that this is my place.  Callie was attending a Vacation Bible School in Poteet, Texas, yet her smile was as big as if she was about to ride Space Mountain at Disney. What I’m trying to say here is that while I was away from my church community, I started to miss it, even though I was in a place that was supposed to be the happiest place on earth.  And it made me reflect.  I thought “What if I never got to go back?” “ Am I taking my church family for granted?”  “What if I don’t ever get to feel the joy that I feel in that place with those people?” The presence of happiness, joy, and excitement can be anywhere, even in this very chapel, it doesn’t have to be in a beach in the caribbean, and this is when I realized that you don't have to go all the way to disney to be in the greatest place on earth because the greatest place on earth is the place where the spirit of God comes alive in you. And it made me commit to not taking things for granted. I hope that by now you have thought of the place that you feel the happiest, the place that you feel the safest, the place that you never want to leave from, and I hope that you learn to appreciate it more because there could be a day where you never go back. There could be a day that your happy place is changed into something else, and there could be a day where we don’t wake up that morning to experience happiness at our favorite place.  There’s a famous saying, which says that “Tomorrow is not promised”. However, God calls us to seize the day and live each day like it’s our last.  In the Bible, Psalm 118:24 says that “This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it”. Remember that tomorrow is not promised, it isn’t guaranteed that we will live to see another day so we should live each day like it’s our last. I hope we can learn to take advantage of the days we are given.  We don’t need to go to Disney to find the peace we seek. A content and happy heart is closer than we think, in fact it’s usually right in front of us or literally within us.  Today I’ll be more appreciative of the blessings God has given me and I invite you to do the same.  Thank you. Where is home? Do you mean “Where have you lived the longest?”, “Where were you born?”,  or “Where did you live before here?”, because all of those questions have extremely different answers. Being military, my family always joked that we had no answer when somebody asks us where we’re from. When I was 10 years old, that was supposed to change after my dad left Army Active Duty. We could finally have some permanence an hour's drive from Frankfurt, Germany in a picturesque, hilltop village called Melkerei. My mom was livid when we learned about our drastic move to Europe. My dad had, once again, failed to consult the family whenever it came to relocation. The move was quite rocky at first. Upon our arrival, the US government placed us in temporary housing. It was the hottest summer on record, and we found ourselves on the third floor of a multi-family house without air-conditioning. My sister and I would frequently drag our pillows and blankets from the loft bedroom to sleep on the cooler living room tile floor. Within the first 9 months of our arrival, we had bought and renovated a concrete block home within walking distance to the Nanstein Castle. I chose my bedroom, the location of my skylight, and positioned my newly purchased German bed against the sloped walls and under the opened skylight window. Although, occasionally, I would forget to close the window during the thunderstorms and would return to a sopping wet mattress. Regardless of the consistent reprimands from my mom, I often climbed onto my roof and sat on the clay tiles to watch the stars for hours. My sister and I would bundle up and climb onto the roof to watch the fireworks on the best holiday: Slyvester or New Year’s Eve. This is one day of the year where Germans could break all rules and spend an inordinate amount of time and money firing crazy amounts of fireworks. From our roof overlooking the village, the explosions were sometimes so close that tiles would shake. It was like watching a war. It was wonderful. One extra element that defined my life in Germany was that both my sister and I were homeschooled. This meant that we could abide by our own schedules, start and finish the school day whenever we wanted, and take our work with us on trips. This additional freedom allowed us to do so much throughout our time there. We would frequently take the train, alone to nearby towns like Heidelberg, Trier, Saarbrucken. There we would walk the squares and get crepes and reisecke. After getting a Polish-born dark brown Welsh Cob legally named Limetree Melody Maker (known to my family as Stan), Equestrian jumping and dressage became my primary sport (Que horse-girl jokes). However, in order to ride in Germany, I had to pass the riding licensing tests known as the Reitabzeichen. Competitions exposed me to much of the culture, like the incomprehensible regional German dialects as well as the SuperDickmann sandwich, which is basically two chocolate-covered marshmallows in a sliced baguette. I absolutely loved my life in Germany. The freedom to explore, my wonderful horse, my German friends at the barn, and even my sweet German neighbors who adopted me as their own granddaughter by inviting me in for kuchen (cake) and gossip. My comfortable, yet fascinating life in Germany was once again turned on its head. The permanence that I had finally established dissipated when my parents decided that I should attend high school in America. Unsure of where my dad would find a new job, we took a gamble and moved to San Antonio. I moved with my mom, in August less than a week before school started. My sister had moved on to college, and my dad remained in Germany waiting on the US Government to officially move him back to America. So here I was in this hot, humid, traffic-filled monster of a city. America was ironically foreign, and I desperately missed the tranquility of the German forest. I was now separated from my dad, my friends, my horse, and my home by the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. 
If you were to join a Lacrosse team, what number would you choose to put on the back of your jersey? Perhaps your lucky number or the number of a famous athlete you admire? Maybe the number in your mind has a personal connection to you or a story behind it. I know the number 25 is near to my heart because it's the number that I have worn while I have played lacrosse at TMI. It is the number that I won a State Championship in and the  number I have worn while making long-lasting friendships and memories that will last forever.  Playing on multiple different sports and club teams growing up has resulted in me wearing a variety of different numbers. But having worn many numbers before, the number one sticks out to me as one of the most impactful because it represents family, kindness, and servanthood. My friend and teammate Taden was a fierce competitor who impacted every teammate on and off the field. He was often times one of the shortest kids on the field, but what he lacked for in height, he made up for with strength, skill, and pure aggression. He was the kind of player who would stop at nothing to win and he was the most competitive player on the field during games. But afterward, he was your best friend and acted like he didn’t just abuse your arm with his 6 foot dpole. Taden found peace when he was on the lacrosse field, whether that was with his school team or one of the various club teams he played for in the summer and fall. Unfortunately, he had torn his ACL during the spring season of 2021, even though he was sidelined, Taden loved nothing more than to watch other people succeed. He constantly worked to make everyone else better on and off the field-- whether teaching someone how to play the game of lacrosse, helping a classmate with a difficult math problem, or helping his friends strengthen their spiritual walk with Christ. Taden pushed all of his friends to be the best version of themselves that they could possibly be. He was the kind of friend who invited you to church every Sunday or sat with you at the lunch table if you were eating by yourself. During a lacrosse tournament in Virginia last June, Taden was still healing from his recent ACL tear. Taden and his dad had flown all the way out to Richmond, to support the team and some of his best friends. Taden knew he wouldn't be able to play the sport that he loved, but he was excited to watch all of his friends play and cheer us on throughout the weekend. The evening before the tournament, I was at the fields getting some extra practice to make sure my stick was throwing well after the long plane ride earlier that morning. About 30 minutes into my self-driven practice session, I heard my name shouted across the field complex, and to my surprise, it was Taden and another one of my other teammates. Taden, right off the bat, started talking to me about my trip to the east coast, and about how our summers had been. I had met Taden only a few times before that conversation, but by the end, it seemed like we were old friends who had known each other for years. Taden and I bonded instantly over three things, our love of lacrosse, our love of Jesus Christ, and a love for the outdoors. In fact, within an hour of the conversation, we had already made plans to drive up to Montana for a fishing trip the summer after our senior year. By the time we had finished our time in fantasy land, it was already 10 o'clock in the evening. So, we went to our hotels to prepare for the weekend ahead. Less than 8 hours later, at 7 AM on a Saturday morning, we met up again at the fields, ready to play our first game. As the day progressed, Taden was on our sideline, cheering us on as our hype man. Whenever the team would score or do something cool, you could hear Taden on the sideline going absolutely crazy. What seemed like every few seconds he was jumping up and down having to pick up his hat after it flew off his head falling on the ground. Likewise, when one of us on the team did something wrong, the coach he would get up in our faces and threaten to take us out of the game. A tsunami of spit would be flying out of his mouth and landing on our faces.   On a few occasions, I overheard coach tell a player to “go back to the baseball field because he has no place on the team” but he wouldn’t let people feel defeated, Taden would calmly explain to us what happened and what to do differently next time to prevent getting chewed out. In simple terms, Taden was the calm after the storm; scratch that, he was the calm after the category-five hurricane.
My favorite song lyrics come from a well-known Brazilian Bossa, Desde Que o Samba é Samba by Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. The lyrics in Portuguese “Solidão apavora. Tudo demorando em ser tão ruim. Mas alguma coisa acontece no quando agora em mim. Cantando eu mando a tristeza embora.” For those who don’t understand Portuguese, these song lyrics approximately translate to: “The loneliness terrifies; The worst is yet to come; But something presently happens in me; By singing, I send the sadness away”. The meaning behind this musical poem is simplistic but memorable. The two songwriters wrote this song as an ode to their love for samba and the joy and comfort that they find from the music that makes all the loneliness and sadness in the world melt away.Although the English translation may not have been grammatically accurate, I find that the Portuguese verbiage is perfect just the way it is. For a long time, I was unsure of my identity. My legal identity has always been that I am a white Latina Brazilian-American with a pinch of Spanish ancestry from my Grandma’s side. My parents were both born and raised in Brazil, much like most of my family members; however, unlike the rest of my family, my parents’ plan for after they married was to move to the US for just a few years to finish up college and grad school and then to move back to Brazil to the comfort of their family. Funnily enough, the last bit of that plan never ended up happening, and a few years later, I was born here in Texas, destined to live the rest of my life as a fully-fledged American citizen. When I was starting to form words and speak back to my parents in fragmented baby sentences, the only language I would speak was Portuguese. My parents, who were still in the process of learning English at the time, would only speak Portuguese to me when they were home. On top of that, my vovó, (which means grandma in Portuguese) who didn’t speak a single word of English, took care of me for almost a year while my parents were working, so it wasn’t too surprising that English became my second language. Although I am much more comfortable speaking English now, I wish my parents had forced me a little more to keep up my Portuguese. The more I learned English in school, the less I was able to remember the almost perfect Portuguese I used to speak. Out of the house, there were barely any Portuguese speakers around me, so the way to ‘fit in’ was for me to learn English. This not only made my parents a bit disappointed, but also began my journey into the wormhole that was my identity. As I entered elementary school, there were a few surprises I encountered. Every year till approximately the 4th grade, when my peers were all bragging about our cultures and our parent’s origins, at least one person in my class would beg me, the only person of Brazilian ancestry in the school, to speak Portuguese for them as if it were a mysteriously enchanting alien language. Every time, without fail, I would proudly speak a sentence or two and amaze my classmates. I would say something along the lines of "Você não pode me entender, então posso dizer coisas malucas como você é burro como um jacaré.” They would ooh and aww to the sound of my silly sentences and would then bombard me with questions about my origins. Although I took pride in showing off my culture to my uneducated peers, I always felt a sort of anxiety about discussing my knowledge as I did not feel like a certified enough Brazilian to talk about the country and language. My quiet nature certainly didn’t help this original anxiety and over time I stopped talking about my culture entirely. Many of even my closest friends would mistake me for being Mexican or Colombian and through gritted teeth, I would have to explain their mistake. Moreover, I found myself trying to simplify the country to the overall vibes and emotions I had towards it instead of facts and society as a whole. One of the best ways I found of explaining it to my young peers was comparing it to the classic early 2000s movie, Rio. For those who are unfamiliar with the movie, it follows the story of a blue macaw that gets captured and taken from his home in Minnesota to the city his family was originally from, Rio de Janeiro. Although the movie is a comedic animated adventure that uses a lot of stereotypes and over-the-top characters, there was one aspect of big-city Brazilian culture that it got right: the Carnaval do Rio de Janeiro. When my parents used to have the International Globo Channel on the TV, I would beg for them to play the carnival every year on the days before Lent. The full stimulation of the bright rainbow array of colorful costumes and the loud samba music combined with the overall celebratory atmosphere would keep my eyes glued to the screen for many hours through the night. Although I was too young to stay up late watching the whole festival, I fell asleep dreaming of the music. Because of the connection to the carnival, I was in love with the samba my mom would listen to as she cooked. The more I would watch replays of the festivals, the more I felt disconnected from the very distant city I had visited so many times before. For that, I desired to become better connected to my heritage. Though I didn’t have much coordination when I was little, I would dance to the samba every day as if I were one of the dancers in the parade. In fact, I would take pride in dressing like the famous 1950s samba singer Carmen Miranda for Halloween and using my Folklorico practice skirt and a colorful fiesta top as a makeshift carnival costume. For a long time, I thought dancing and dressing up were the only things that connected me to my identity. This was until I discovered what would later become my favorite musical genre known as bossa nova. As opposed to the electrifying mix of different percussion instruments found in traditional samba, bossa nova has a more calming sound that many associate with cool jazz. According to the Brazilian journalist Ruy Castro, the main characteristic behind bossa nova known as “the bossa beat” was “an extreme simplification of the beat [from] the [traditional] samba school as if all the instruments had been removed and only the tamborim had been preserved.”
