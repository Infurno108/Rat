I am an optimist. I like to look on the bright side of things whenever I can. Whenever I am down I reset my thoughts by saying “it is what it is” and look for solutions. Now, this last year tended to be a very “It is what it is” kind of year, but I found that that is the exact thing I needed to say. With little control over our current situation I tried to make the best of the worst conditions. I worked to have fun and enjoy my junior year and make it my best year yet. And with my new attitude and new friends I had the time of my life. To give you an idea of what was upcoming for me I will give you the general overview. I was going to C dorm as the prefect that year. For me, C was like a Found family comedy like Friends or How I Met your Mother in which the cast would always get into some sort of crazy scenario and end up closer because of it. Because of this I will set the cast and stage so you can see from my point of view. Coming with me were two sophomores (Ryan and Flint), another junior (Matthew), and our one senior, (Joey) who was in C dorm previous years.  We all lived in C and it was one of the older dorms that had lots of faults that weren’t present in the new dorms. But no matter its faults and issues, C dorm made up for it in character and memories. Now that you have the general overview, let's begin. Despite having to go through quarantine before, I did not realize the extent to which quarantine meant in the dorms. Although I and the other Junior Matthew had cars, we were not allowed to leave at all.
Throughout my life, I have been given many different names. These include “little Kyle”, “the youngest Kyle”, “the last of the Kyles”, “the baby of the family”. I have even been called “pipsqueak”, a name first given to me by my aunt, but then so lovingly adopted by my oldest brother, more based on the fact that I am the shortest out of my siblings than the youngest, but a name that I have been referred to as nonetheless. The majority of my life has been based on my three older siblings. I have gone to the same schools as them, taken the same classes, played the same sports, and tried all of the same hobbies. This led me to being a very annoying little sister, which I have unfortunately always been aware of thanks to one of my brothers. For the most part though, my siblings have been very accepting of my constant desire to tag along and ask incessant questions, even when seeking their acceptance has led to major regret and quite a bit of crying. As a kid I would get scared very easily. That’s not to say that I don't anymore, but it is not nearly as bad as having nightmares about the movies Jaws and Gremlins for months after watching them. My sister was forced to deal with my constant paranoia before falling asleep every night during those periods considering we shared a bedroom for the majority of my life. However, I was always convinced that I would be able to make it through the same scary things as the rest of my family. 
I was 13 years old when my father decided to walk out of my life. If I am being honest, he had left my family long before he physically walked out the door. You learn quickly when bad things like this happen, it is either learn to cope or decide to cave. When my father left I think I did both. Facing the music of my reality, there was a lot of crying and letting little things get to me. Luckily, I like roller coasters so this ride of emotion called “cold reality” was starting to hit home. In today’s world, “coping” is an often used buzzword but I don’t think most of us grasp the true meaning of “coping.”  For those who don’t know what coping is let me give you the dictionary definition:   “to deal effectively with something difficult.” True coping requires more than just “dealing” with it, you need to do it effectively and it became clear pretty quickly I didn’t understand that part of it. ​To “cope” with his leaving I turned to video games and sleeping. When I played games it took me to a different world, a world where I did not have to deal with the thoughts and feelings I had about my situation at hand. However, because of this, my grades reflected this unhealthy coping method. My grades were dropping and the mask I put on at school was starting to slip off.
Life is like a beast, always moving, changing, and growing, but it will devour you if you don’t keep up with it. An interpretation of Charles Darwin once said, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.” Let me say that again, it is not the strongest or smartest who survive, but those who can adapt.  We all have this in common, at some point we will all have to face adversity in some form or another. In this interpretation, survivors don’t power through it or outthink it, they adapt to it to win.  We all wish there was some way to hit the pause button on life and maybe even a cheat code around the hardest parts, but they don’t exist. There is no way to stop life from going forward, no matter what someone may go through, we as people need to be able to adapt to survive. As you can probably guess, lacrosse has taught me a lot about life. If you do not know, lacrosse is a full-contact sport that requires you to drive through the defenders to get a goal.  Sometimes you dodge, sometimes you dive, and most times you get hit.  Everyone who has played lacrosse with me knows that I am known for getting hit. Hit pretty hard in fact. So hard, they gave me a nickname: Gumby. That name is not because I get hit hard though.  It’s because no matter how hard, I still get up. I do this because what is the point of staying on the ground? If I have not suffered a severe injury, why stay down?
Oftentimes, I believe myself to be one of the unluckiest people on Earth. While this isn’t uncommon for your average teenager, I happen to have this feeling quite frequently. As a control freak, I keep my grip on reality by attempting to limit negative outcomes while maximizing positive ones. To me, the idea of something being entirely out of my control is unnerving and frustrating. Unfortunately, no one can control everything because life inherently involves luck and chance. Often, I feel as if I always pull the short straw, and as I’ve grown, my own circumstances have continued to make life an increasingly risky game. But if given the opportunity to gain complete control over my life, I wouldn’t take it because over the past seven years, my life’s unlucky and uncontrollable situations have undoubtedly shaped me into a better person. If you don’t know me personally, I have a very tragic talent for being extremely clumsy. For me, the seemingly simple act of walking often leads to bruises and scratches. As an athlete, clumsiness-- along with a strong competitive nature-- opens up a multitude of opportunities for broken bones, twisted ankles, and pulled muscles. (As you can see right here with my broken wrist so being on this stage with stairs right in front of me is extremely scary). 
I distinctly remember waking up to the sound of my alarm blaring to an all too familiar sound. I slammed the top of the alarm as I had every morning before, but I knew this morning was different. Up until that moment the true reality of what I had gotten myself into had not truly settled in, the days and months leading up to me coming to TMI had seemed more like preparation for a summer camp than moving into a boarding school, but in that moment staring at my ceiling as my roommate stirred across the room, everything suddenly hit me at once. The only thing left in my mind was the thought, “I messed up really bad this time”.  School had been one of the places I despised most in the world, and now I had gotten myself stuck living there for the rest of the year. The strenuous series of events that ended up with me standing here today all started 2 years before I first came to TMI. 
It is my opinion that any chapel talk that hopes to stick into the tiktok length attention span of the average TMI students brain, needs to clearly state what it's about very early on in the talk while all the listeners are still awake.To put it bluntly I want to talk about time, specifically how we handle it with our habits and how making tiny changes now can change the trajectory of your whole life. Now, the genesis of this talk is a TMI 2015 convocation day video, which was in fact the first glimpse I had into TMI life before I was a student, and it got me thinking about time. Every single person in that video, with the exception of some of our ancient faculty and staff, is no longer ats TMI .when that video was filmed however they were just students at TMI, same as me and you however the main difference between them and you currently is that their time as a highschool school student, is over, its finished for them, but for you, its not, you still have time left here, whether that be years or 77 days exactly including today.
Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity. Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are the type of person who likes music. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete. Each time you encourage your cadets, you are a leader. Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. 
Every day from kindergarten to 8th grade, we would have a daily chapel to begin every school day. These chapel days would be led by the school’s headmaster, Mr. Webster. Mr. Webster is not only one of the best speakers I have ever heard, not only one of the best role models ever, but he is one of the best people I have ever met. He is the example of a perfect, loving person. Mr. Webster, also known as El Guapo, is a tall man who loves wearing his suits with blue jeans. He is someone who made an impact on everyone. Ask anyone who knows him, and they will say how much they love him. Even when I went to my sister’s chapel talk back in 2015, I was asked many times by TMI faculty about Mr. Webster. Everyone knows him because he just is so great. Everyday during chapel, he would show a clip of a movie, and then he would talk about a life lesson that was shown in that movie. He would talk about laziness or how to use our values to bring up a better life for ourselves. There are infinitely many quotes he had that are beautiful, however, my favorite one is “Let love and honesty rule your life.
Not only that, but I have been since I was five years old. Growing up in a house that primarily spoke Arabic and French, those languages came to me naturally. Altering every word, creating new words, and switching to different languages in one sentence is commonplace in my household. My mom and dad were both born in Lebanon, a small country located in the Middle East. My mom is fully Lebanese, and my father is half French and half Armenian. Growing up in Lebanon, French and Arabic were their first two languages, so there was no doubt that their two children would eventually learn them too. They both came here as young adults, and although adjustment was difficult, they seemed totally fine with their dichotomous world: American outside the house and something different at home. They appeared at ease with different foods, different music, and even different humor, matching their surroundings at any moment. They had friends that were like them and other, more traditional Americans, for lack of better words. Early in my life, I never realized this complexity. It was perfectly normal for me to watch Spongebob and Sesame Street in English while simultaneously speaking in Arabic or French to my mother. At times, I would also watch cartoons or acrobats on the French satellite channel TV5. And to be quite honest, I thought this is what everyone else did too. I was in, what I would call, an ethnic enclave. It was the same for my brother. I enjoyed my Lebanese and French dishes cooked by my mom while also occasionally enjoying a hot dog, a burger, or mac and cheese. I didn’t have much American influence at home, but I never felt out of place. I never seemed to question who and where I was and how I got here. As I started school, things got more complicated.
“All in”, I announced, as an over-hyped me pushed my dignity along with every single one of my chips into the center of the poker table. I stared right into Chris Goldsbury’s clear blue eyes as I shoved everything into the pot, hoping to catch the slightest glimpse of stress or uncertainty in his face gained from my calling his bet. To my horror, he just aimed his usual friendly smile back at me. It was only him and I left in the hand, and we had both put it all on the line. It was the final hand of the night, and I had chosen to leave my fate in the hands of luck. Lucky for me, I had been having no shortage of it that night. Just five minutes prior to going all in, I was balling. I felt like I had luck on my side and was on top of the world as I had been winning so much that I was ready to cash in my chips and go buy both Boardwalk and Park Place.
I was never a perfect student, I got A’s on occasion but I was mostly a B student which meant I was average, mediocre, and unremarkable. My academics were not particularly noteworthy or impressive. I would go to school and constantly look for distractions to get me out of class. I would talk with my friends, ask to go to the restroom, or even enjoy the occasional fire drill just to skip that little bit of class. Distractions gave me the ability to forget that I was just an average student. As a result of my lack of focus and dedication to my studies, I often found myself behind in class becoming below average. I would struggle to keep up with the material, and my grades would suffer as a result. I would try to make up for it by studying harder and putting in more effort, but it was always an uphill battle. I was never able to fully catch up, and I would always end up feeling lost, frustrated, and discouraged, but then we hit this one unit in science class - life cycles. This topic caught my interest and made me think. For the first time, I found myself looking forward to going to class. I was fascinated by the way that different organisms developed and changed over time. 
"Why am I doing this?" That was a question I had in mind ever since middle school. Korea’s education system makes everyone fixate on grades and getting into those top 3 colleges, resulting in the craze of after school academies trapping students often past midnight every single day. During my time in Korea, where I spent most of my life, I didn’t know the purpose of me as a person. I felt like I was just wasting my time doing homework, for just some quiz, and a rank that didn't mean much. Summer of 2019, I decided, I needed a break from this cycle. My parents and I decided to look into studying abroad, which was always in the back of my father’s mind. When we found TMI, we fell in love. It was a small private school, away from the city, surrounded by nature. As I was looking for something completely different from my experience in Korea, it was perfect. Stereotypical statement from immigrants, but for me, America really was the land of opportunities. It was a second chance in life where I was given a blank canvas and was able to make that painting whatever I wanted it to be. However, this new painting I had to do was very far from home, and very far from what I was used to. Living by myself, alone in the dorms was probably the biggest change other than the language & cultural barrier I experienced. 
Being one of the only teenagers there, he even gave me a position as altar server. Also with my late grandfather being a very devoted catholic, I felt at home connecting to god, and connecting to my family through him. By reconnecting with religion and some Korean food, I found myself recharging every time I went to church. I also had my closest friends, Jeongho and Matthew. We lived together for three years, and they are like my brothers now. Although we often argued about dumb stuff like why you shouldn’t have rice with chopsticks, we had a lot of fun together. I remember the three of us going to cars and coffee on saturday mornings, or the regular trips to Target to buy useless stuff. I’m grateful for these guys, always being by my side throughout the years. And on top of that, I was lucky enough to have Major Claburn and his family to let me stay at their house over one of the breaks. Mrs.Claburn treated me like her own son, and would invite me over for dinner often. Julia and William were like the annoying siblings I never had, and Major, although not too talkative, cooked me the best steak dinners with his grill setup. They provided me with the warmth of family, and some warm and delicious t-bone steaks. Realizing the support of all these people around me, I was able to dust myself off and pull myself back together. This time I decided, I’ll set achievable goals for myself, and each time I complete those, I'd set new goals that were, again, easily achievable. I started by taking cold showers everyday, cut down on caffeine and sweets, and worked out more often. 
just how lucky I am, I also understood how important it would be to remember that very moment. This realization contributed to my personal growth and changed how I understand my place in this world. Without it, I might have gone through life assuming that all I was given is normal. I might not have fully appreciated how fortunate I am to have something as simple as a good family and a good group of friends, and I may never have realized how easy it is to take things for granted–I am admittedly still occasionally guilty of it to this day. Recognizing one’s privilege is a difficult thing to do. But it has changed the way I approach all aspects of my life. This can take the form of small actions such as picking up a random piece of trash or telling someone I like their outfit, or it can be in bigger sentiments such as dedicating my weekend to help raise funds to support the education of children in underprivileged countries. And most importantly it has taught me to look at the world through a lens of unconditional gratitude. By doing these sorts of things, I hope my path through this world will be defined by kindness, respect, and appreciation for the blessings I have been given. TMI, I challenge you to do the same. As our chaplain, Father Ben, preaches, there is not enough room in our hearts for both misery and gratitude, and while I understand it is easy to be defeated by all of the challenges life throws your way, make sure you are fighting to stay positive and appreciate the blessing you have been given as well as spreading them to those who need it. This does not mean sacrificing your weekend to go make food for the homeless. It can be a text to a friend who is struggling in school. It can be a thank you to your parents for all they have done. It can also be a simple prayer in your mind thanking God for your health and happiness. Thank you and Happy Birthday to my Chapel Talk Coach Mr. Ridewood.
I am one of 6 kids, growing up everything felt like a competition. Who was the best behaved? Who helped the most around the house? Who was the best at mario party? Who was the best at singing? It all felt like one massive triathlon, with the grand prize being attention. I quickly ruled myself out of most of those competitions, but the one thing I decided I could stand my ground in was the smart competition, so I chose that one to focus my energy on. I didn’t care that I wasn’t the most athletic in my family, or the funniest, or that I wasn’t the best at singing. I cared about the “who was the smartest” competition.
“Not all that COUNTS can be COUNTED, -and not all that can be COUNTED, -COUNTS” Originally I had Two chapel talks, and Fr. Ben said “You only have ONE talk” so I had to make it count. I’m Going to tell you a couple of stories that have taught me what really counts. Picture this. - It's the first day of high school and I am brand new to TMI. I have my new uniform on, with some fresh khaki shorts and I am nervous yet excited to see what TMI is all about. My parents dropped me off at the flag circle and I headed into the gym for a meet and greet for new families and students.
Waking up to the sound of birds with the sun shining through the trees suddenly turns into the sound of construction and massive buildings blocking the light and casting a gloomy shadow into my room. The mountain I grew up on where you could drive for miles only seeing nature suddenly became driving through traffic with skyscrapers surrounding the view. For most of my life I grew up in Waynesville, North Carolina. It was a town where there wasn't much to go and do,  but there was a lot to see. 
I spent day after day doing what I used to look forward to: resting with my head on a pillow. I didn’t realize how bad this was at the time, though. However, my mom used her mother's instinct and saw this much more apparently than I did. She informed our relatives of our situation, and my aunt drove down from Dallas despite her and my uncle’s upcoming plan: a hiking trip to Utah With both my mom and aunt having a mother’s instinct, they made an arrangement so my twin sister and I could join my aunt and uncle on this unexpected getaway. 
As I scanned through images of Zion National Park on my phone, I couldn’t help but have an ounce of dread as I imagined climbing rocks in the heat for days on end. I was at a place in which sleeping seemed the only suitable thing to do. But of course, I was excited and grateful for this trip. I was also full of anticipation. Having a mom who plans trips a year in advance, the spontaneity of it all was a completely new experience. 
If you were to join a Lacrosse team, what number would you choose to put on the back of your jersey? Perhaps your lucky number or the number of a famous athlete you admire? Maybe the number in your mind has a personal connection to you or a story behind it. I know the number 25 is near to my heart because it's the number that I have worn while I have played lacrosse at TMI. It is the number that I won a State Championship in and the  number I have worn while making long-lasting friendships and memories that will last forever. 
My favorite song lyrics come from a well-known Brazilian Bossa, Desde Que o Samba é Samba by Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. The lyrics in Portuguese “Solidão apavora. Tudo demorando em ser tão ruim. Mas alguma coisa acontece no quando agora em mim. Cantando eu mando a tristeza embora.” For those who don’t understand Portuguese, these song lyrics approximately translate to: “The loneliness terrifies; The worst is yet to come; But something presently happens in me; By singing, I send the sadness away”.
Rome was not built in a day, and neither is any civilization. Humankind, or Homo Sapiens, or Cro Magnons, or whatever you would like to call us, have been around for about sixty-thousand years. We started out as what we might refer to as “cavemen”, but, slowly but surely, over the course of sixty-thousand years, managed to invent vaccines and supercomputers, master both sea and sky, and spread ourselves and our parking lots over nearly every corner of the Earth. So the question, then, is how? What exactly is it that turned a bunch of primates in a cave into a bunch of primates in a Whataburger parking lot? How did we get here?
