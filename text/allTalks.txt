I am an optimist. I like to look on the bright side of things whenever I can. Whenever I am down I reset my thoughts by saying “it is what it is” and look for solutions. Now, this last year tended to be a very “It is what it is” kind of year, but I found that that is the exact thing I needed to say. With little control over our current situation I tried to make the best of the worst conditions. I worked to have fun and enjoy my junior year and make it my best year yet. And with my new attitude and new friends I had the time of my life. To give you an idea of what was upcoming for me I will give you the general overview. I was going to C dorm as the prefect that year. For me, C was like a Found family comedy like Friends or How I Met your Mother in which the cast would always get into some sort of crazy scenario and end up closer because of it. Because of this I will set the cast and stage so you can see from my point of view. Coming with me were two sophomores (Ryan and Flint), another junior (Matthew), and our one senior, (Joey) who was in C dorm previous years.  We all lived in C and it was one of the older dorms that had lots of faults that weren’t present in the new dorms. But no matter its faults and issues, C dorm made up for it in character and memories. Now that you have the general overview, let's begin. Despite having to go through quarantine before, I did not realize the extent to which quarantine meant in the dorms. Although I and the other Junior Matthew had cars, we were not allowed to leave at all. In fact, visits outside of our dorm became much more of a hassle because each house was declared its own “unit” and had to stick with their own. Now I am not saying that these rules were unjust, but they did make everything more - difficult. To start, our food situation wasn’t ideal. We would have food dropped off in our common room for us for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and the only constant was the poor quality food. We had the saddest chicken for breakfast and lunch most every day with equally awful dinners. But we knew that the quality wouldn’t change on its own so we took up the challenge to fix it. Armed with a hot plate and a simple Chef’s Knife, our master chef Flint would take control of the kitchen. At first it started by recooking the pork in the pork tacos and adding spices and other toppings, but it soon evolved to his specialty Chicken Sandwich. He would sear the chicken with a hot plate to give it a solid crust and he would make his own cane’s sauce. Combined with some toasted bread and smuggled vegetables, we are left with a pleasant sandwich.  We would do this for nearly every meal that we could fix as even though we couldn’t do much, we did what we could with what we were dealt. But not every meal could be fixed. Enter the enchiladas verdes. Although ideas popped up about a potential solution, we realized that some things can’t be fixed. And although nothing could directly fix it, we had prepared for this as we knew that somethings must start anew. Beforehand we went to the store and bought some steak, spinach, and other ingredients for our meal. With our three New York Strips in the freezer and hot plate on, with supervision, we started our feast. Accompanied by the delicate comedy of Southpark and by each other, we were happy. It didn’t matter that we were stuck or why we were stuck, we were happy. This “it is what it is” outlook soon spread to every aspect of our lives. We realized that we may not have had our conventional resources, but we had what we had. We had a group of very different people with various backgrounds and personalities and a Computer and occasional trips to target. So we did what we could with what we had. After classes in online school, we would often go out to the hall and stretch so then we could sit down and watch Southpark or some trash show on the History network. When we had classes together we would go outside and sit with one another. No more Friday movie trips? No problem! We set up our own movie night watching all sorts of movies like Parasite and Bruno. We then added game night playing Dark Souls, Smash Bros., and Undertale. We then ventured into horror games like Dead Space 3 and DDLC. This then led to each of us leading our own journeys. Joey would bring us deep into the Chinese version of Youtube being our tour guide to all the inside jokes. Matthew would lead us on our dorm repair with his janky ideas of “fixed” like paper shadings for hallway lights and a shower curtain as a doorway. The aforementioned Flint would contrast my optimism with his pessimism, cook, and show us his favorite absurdist Australian comedians. And Ryan would sit in his room and do Math homework. Meanwhile I was there watching it all and “supervising” where needed and egging on when I saw the opportunities for a stable level of chaos. Hair cuts? Well we got a $40 razer from Target and five boys giving their ideas of what looks “right”. No more going out for events? Well we have two full water bottles, cardboard boxes, and a hallway so we made a crude one on one bowling game. Every problem we faced we kept our chin up and figured out a solution or workaround. However, there is one problem I couldn’t fix. One Catastrophe that we can’t wait out. The Freeze. Through the night the snow gathered and gathered, and when we awoke it was piled up to amounts TMI hadn’t seen for some time. We had the privilege to see TMI under all that snow and it was amazing. My dorm all ventured out into the snow and we went as far as the lacrosse field. Although I complained of the temperature and my fingers freezing off for the whole time
Throughout my life, I have been given many different names. These include “little Kyle”, “the youngest Kyle”, “the last of the Kyles”, “the baby of the family”. I have even been called “pipsqueak”, a name first given to me by my aunt, but then so lovingly adopted by my oldest brother, more based on the fact that I am the shortest out of my siblings than the youngest, but a name that I have been referred to as nonetheless. The majority of my life has been based on my three older siblings. I have gone to the same schools as them, taken the same classes, played the same sports, and tried all of the same hobbies. This led me to being a very annoying little sister, which I have unfortunately always been aware of thanks to one of my brothers. For the most part though, my siblings have been very accepting of my constant desire to tag along and ask incessant questions, even when seeking their acceptance has led to major regret and quite a bit of crying. As a kid I would get scared very easily. That’s not to say that I don't anymore, but it is not nearly as bad as having nightmares about the movies Jaws and Gremlins for months after watching them. My sister was forced to deal with my constant paranoia before falling asleep every night during those periods considering we shared a bedroom for the majority of my life. However, I was always convinced that I would be able to make it through the same scary things as the rest of my family. Hence why when my parents brought up the idea of going to the haunted house, "The Nightmare on Elm Street," I attempted to convince everyone else of my bravery. Keep in mind, I was eight. There was no sign that I would be able to successfully make it through a haunted house. I could barely even handle playing "Call of Duty'' because I got startled by other players coming around a corner in front of me. Despite this, I had far too much faith in myself. My siblings knew better. They remembered my fear more clearly than I had, but I insisted that this time it would somehow be different. I am still unsure why anyone thought to even consider letting four children into a haunted house like that. Given that there are at least ratings on movies,
I was 13 years old when my father decided to walk out of my life. If I am being honest, he had left my family long before he physically walked out the door. You learn quickly when bad things like this happen, it is either learn to cope or decide to cave. When my father left I think I did both. Facing the music of my reality, there was a lot of crying and letting little things get to me. Luckily, I like roller coasters so this ride of emotion called “cold reality” was starting to hit home. In today’s world, “coping” is an often used buzzword but I don’t think most of us grasp the true meaning of “coping.”  For those who don’t know what coping is let me give you the dictionary definition:   “to deal effectively with something difficult.” True coping requires more than just “dealing” with it, you need to do it effectively and it became clear pretty quickly I didn’t understand that part of it. ​To “cope” with his leaving I turned to video games and sleeping. When I played games it took me to a different world, a world where I did not have to deal with the thoughts and feelings I had about my situation at hand. However, because of this, my grades reflected this unhealthy coping method. My grades were dropping and the mask I put on at school was starting to slip off. Sadly I didn’t make any changes and my future is affected because of my inability to realize that I was not really coping. Yes, video games are fun and made me feel better, but all it was doing was keeping me occupied until I turned the video games off and those thoughts and feelings I thought I was handling reared their ugly head again. It became clear I was only escaping what I needed to face. Another mechanism I thought was coping was just avoiding anything that had to do with my father. It seemed easier than trying to explain our strange and new family dynamic.  As terrible as it seemed for this to happen 3 days before Thanksgiving, I was kind of thankful it surrounded a holiday because I didn’t have to see anyone. I didn’t have to explain I wasn’t with my parents or why my mom was so sad or why I didn’t want to get out of bed.   Even now, anytime I have a conversation with him as the topic I get physically uncomfortable and I feel sick. I am a work in progress. Healthy coping is when there is a positive outcome and you have positive relationships. I put on a facade so I wouldn’t have to talk about it, to anyone. As it turns out, that wasn’t coping, that was avoidance.  I was struggling in school; I wasn’t progressing in the Corps; and I was separating myself from my friends.  Then we had a Pandemic.  Each of us has a “Covid” story.  Covid was in some way a great outlet for me because it allowed me to further isolate.  School as we knew it ended.  The world shut down but no one understood my world had already closed its borders.  School finally “resumed” virtually but Zoom classes were not my friend.  It turns out, even an introvert needs people. It was still easier for me to hide. I did not excel.  
Life is like a beast, always moving, changing, and growing, but it will devour you if you don’t keep up with it. An interpretation of Charles Darwin once said, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.” Let me say that again, it is not the strongest or smartest who survive, but those who can adapt.  We all have this in common, at some point we will all have to face adversity in some form or another. In this interpretation, survivors don’t power through it or outthink it, they adapt to it to win.  We all wish there was some way to hit the pause button on life and maybe even a cheat code around the hardest parts, but they don’t exist. There is no way to stop life from going forward, no matter what someone may go through, we as people need to be able to adapt to survive. As you can probably guess, lacrosse has taught me a lot about life. If you do not know, lacrosse is a full-contact sport that requires you to drive through the defenders to get a goal.  Sometimes you dodge, sometimes you dive, and most times you get hit.  Everyone who has played lacrosse with me knows that I am know
Oftentimes, I believe myself to be one of the unluckiest people on Earth. While this isn’t uncommon for your average teenager, I happen to have this feeling quite frequently. As a control freak, I keep my grip on reality by attempting to limit negative outcomes while maximizing positive ones. To me, the idea of something being entirely out of my control is unnerving and frustrating. Unfortunately, no one can control everything because life inherently involves luck and chance. Often, I feel as if I always pull the short straw, and as I’ve grown, my own circumstances have continued to make life an increasingly risky game. But if given the opportunity to gain complete control over my life, I wouldn’t take it because over the past seven years, my life’s unlucky and uncontrollable situations have undoubtedly shaped me into a better person. If you don’t know me personally, I have a very tragic talent for being extremely clumsy. For me, the seemingly simple act of walking often leads to bruises and scratches. As an athlete, clumsiness-- along with a strong competitive nature-- opens up a multitude of opportunities for broken bones, twisted ankles, and pulled muscles. (As you can see right here with my broken wrist so being on this stage with stairs right in front of me is extremely scary). Since the fifth grade, I haven’t gone a year without at least one injury. Clearly, this is a bit unlucky, right? At first, I thought so too. In my book, however, those were the lucky injuries. Those were the ones I could always bounce back from. On the other hand, my unluckiest and most consistent talent, which basically defines my entire athletic career, is my unnatural and surprising ability to get a concussion in any given situation. As ridiculous as this sounds, I seriously do have an uncanny talent for getting concussions. In any contact sport, concussions are a given risk, but with girls' soccer having the second-highest concussion rate among high school sports (UPMC), my chances of getting a concussion are significantly higher. With already bad odds, I always took extra precautions to avoid injury by wearing ugly, bulky headgear: like this concussion headband (show concussion headband). Whether heading a soccer ball, hitting the ground, or even someone else’s head, this headband is supposed to provide a certain level of protection for common areas of impact. However, in my very unfortunate case, this headband provides little protection, as more often than not, soccer balls slam directly into my face instead of the headband. (Let me illustrate this phenomenon for you.) Unfortunately, even outside of soccer, my odds are not much better. Oftentimes, by simply existing, I am prone to concussions. By the end of my eighth-grade year at TMI, I had sustained multiple concussions from several activities including soccer, basketball, and surprisingly, science challenge. With my reputation and my own little gravitational force field surrounding my head, I was basically an urban legend under the constant threat of flying objects. However, there’s one occasion, which occurred on our end-of-the-year field trip, that really proves the enormity of my unluckiness. Though my memory is slightly vague, I remember my entire eighth-grade class had been on a basketball court at Mo Ranch. On one side, I was talking to a group of my friends, and on the opposite side, a group was playing with my soccer ball. Suddenly, I heard my name being called, and as I turned around, I felt the sting of my own soccer ball colliding with my face and immediately collapsed (and a huge thank you to Andy Cubriel because that was one of the funniest ways to conclude TMI middle school). Looking back at this moment, neither I or my friends know how this is statistically possible. 
I distinctly remember waking up to the sound of my alarm blaring to an all too familiar sound. I slammed the top of the alarm as I had every morning before, but I knew this morning was different. Up until that moment the true reality of what I had gotten myself into had not truly settled in, the days and months leading up to me coming to TMI had seemed more like preparation for a summer camp than moving into a boarding school, but in that moment staring at my ceiling as my roommate stirred across the room, everything suddenly hit me at once. The only thing left in my mind was the thought, “I messed up really bad this time”.  School had been one of the places I despised most in the world, and now I had gotten myself stuck living there for the rest of the year. The strenuous series of events that ended up with me standing here today all started 2 years before I first came to TMI. I had lived most of my life on the northside of Houston in The Woodlands and in my mind this was the place that I thought would always be my home. I had imagined my friends and I all going to the same high school and graduating together, but none of this was meant to be. One night at dinner my parents asked me how I felt about moving, and not realizing the seriousness of the question, I agreed that living in a new city could be interesting and not much more discussion of the subject was brought up. I went on with my life like normal, thinking nothing of the conversation until a couple months later it was brought up again, but this time it was not a question. I was told that my dad was going to be switching jobs and that we would be moving to Corpus Christi after the school year ended in a few months. As many kids would hearing this news I did not take it well. I hated the idea of leaving my home and my friends. From my stubbornness and anger the idea began to form that I would simply just not leave. 
It is my opinion that any chapel talk that hopes to stick into the tiktok length attention span of the average TMI students brain, needs to clearly state what it's about very early on in the talk while all the listeners are still awake.To put it bluntly I want to talk about time, specifically how we handle it with our habits and how making tiny changes now can change the trajectory of your whole life. Now, the genesis of this talk is a TMI 2015 convocation day video, which was in fact the first glimpse I had into TMI life before I was a student, and it got me thinking about time. Every single person in that video, with the exception of some of our ancient faculty and staff, is no longer ats TMI .when that video was filmed however they were just students at TMI, same as me and you however the main difference between them and you currently is that their time as a highschool school student, is over, its finished for them, but for you, its not, you still have time left here, whether that be years or 77 days exactly including today. regardless, you will never again in your life be this young and It's easy to look at this statement as very depressing and sad. Rather look at it like this, never again will you have this much opportunity or potential to change the course of your life, now At the core of any good time travel movie a key point will be how any little shift or change in the past can have huge repercussions for the present. Makes logical sense right, now take out the time travel sci fi nonsense, and apply it to right now. Any action or decision you make right now in your life could have immense effects on what happens in the future and so many people fail to consider that. The best time to change your life was yesterday, and the second best is today.
“All in”, I announced, as an over-hyped me pushed my dignity along with every single one of my chips into the center of the poker table. I stared right into Chris Goldsbury’s clear blue eyes as I shoved everything into the pot, hoping to catch the slightest glimpse of stress or uncertainty in his face gained from my calling his bet. To my horror, he just aimed his usual friendly smile back at me. It was only him and I left in the hand, and we had both put it all on the line. It was the final hand of the night, and I had chosen to leave my fate in the hands of luck. Lucky for me, I had been having no shortage of it that night. Just five minutes prior to going all in, I was balling. I felt like I had luck on my side and was on top of the world as I had been winning so much that I was ready to cash in my chips and go buy both Boardwalk and Park Place. It was around 11:55 PM when I asked the house, Carlo Miggins, to cash out. To which he replied, “just wait five more minutes.” I sat back down at the table and, feeling lucky as I was, allowed my friends to coax me into playing another hand. Chris played the hand with unmatched confidence and aggression, despite usually being a conservative and restrained player, causing everybody besides me to fold their cards. He knew his hand had a high value, as he bet more and more money every chance got, with a smug goal of forcing me to match his bet to extract maximum dollars from my wallet. I had a solid hand and was already in too deep by the time Chris went all in. It came down to just the two of us, and Chris had caught me in a flustered state. He realized that the last thing I wanted to do was fold my cards and let my winnings as well as my ego take a hit on the last hand of the night, so he exploited me in my state of delirium. I briefly contemplated folding my cards as I would only be losing about a quarter of my money instead of risking it all, especially when I knew all signs pointed to his hand being stronger than mine. Despite this, I dropped my poker face, allowed my pride to take the wheel, and let any remaining sense of reason fade into the void I call “Yolo” as I reached for all the rest of my chips to match his colossal bet. I was caught dead in the heat of the moment as the whole room gathered around our table, bringing the volume and the pressure to an all-time high. The most humble and sportsmanlike smile crept across Chris’s face as he turned over the winning hand, taunting me back into the depths of my own mind and my now empty wallet. I had lost everything, all in one hand, because of one decision. Similar to poker, life can be a game of luck. There are times when you can make all the right moves and things can still go wrong, and it’s times like these that cause players to stray from their logic. But, in the long run, if you learn to keep your head on your shoulders and continually make the right moves under the right mindset, it can pay off in both games as your odds of winning will be maximized. Although we do not have control over the cards we are dealt, we have constant control over how we let our “luck” affect us mentally. In order to achieve a winning mindset, you have to find your poker face: a mental zone where you allow nothing and no one to phase your outlook on the game. To hold your poker face is to fortify your mind by using your logic to find the best possible outlook.
I was never a perfect student, I got A’s on occasion but I was mostly a B student which meant I was average, mediocre, and unremarkable. My academics were not particularly noteworthy or impressive. I would go to school and constantly look for distractions to get me out of class. I would talk with my friends, ask to go to the restroom, or even enjoy the occasional fire drill just to skip that little bit of class. Distractions gave me the ability to forget that I was just an average student. As a result of my lack of focus and dedication to my studies, I often found myself behind in class becoming below average. I would struggle to keep up with the material, and my grades would suffer as a result. I would try to make up for it by studying harder and putting in more effort, but it was always an uphill battle. I was never able to fully catch up, and I would always end up feeling lost, frustrated, and discouraged, but then we hit this one unit in science class - life cycles. This topic caught my interest and made me think. For the first time, I found myself looking forward to going to class. I was fascinated by the way that different organisms developed and changed over time. This was the only class that I ever wanted to take, the only class I felt motivated to do better in. … Step 1 Airway must be secured with intubation. 7th grade came and I walk into science class expecting to pick up exactly where we left off learning about life and the many living things on earth and how they interacted with each other. All I wanted was to learn more about what makes up life and how we move but instead, I was greeted with rocks. Not even diamonds or emeralds just plain old rocks! I felt robbed, cheated, and empty. I had finally found something I was interested in and it was stripped away from me faster than a TV on black Friday. I was frustrated and upset leading me to fall back into my normal routine of looking for any distraction that came to me.  That was until my 6th-grade teacher Mrs. Mayberry offered an elective course I was able to find that passion again and study what I wanted. … Step 2 Mark the incision sites. In 8th grade, I got to experie
It was another sunny spring day in my fifth grade year, and I was rushing to finish my breakfast because I did not want to cause my family to be late. We were on our way to St. PJ’s Children’s Home to participate in a volunteer project. I was very excited because we had never been to St. PJ’s before, and I had been told that there was a basketball court for me to play on with my friends after the project was over. After a quick 30 minute drive, we arrived at the orphanage, and I jumped out of the car to greet all of my friends. We worked for about half of the day cleaning bedrooms, sweeping kitchen floors, organizing bookshelves, and various other chores that would help the staff and residents. After the cleaning came the part I had really been looking forward to: playing. Some people went to play board games. Some people went to the arts and crafts area, and my friends and I went outside to play basketball. We split up into two teams–each team was a mix of kids from the volunteer group and kids who lived in the orphanage. The game lasted about thirty minutes, after which we all went inside to feast on the various snacks and juices provided to us. The volunteer project described above was fairly routine to me as volunteer work has been an important part of who I am for my entire life. Both of my parents came from humble beginnings, and they completely uprooted their lives for my brother and me. They came to this country with nothing to their name, and even after their decades of hard work to reach the place they are now, they continued to stress the importance of giving back to the less fortunate. My parents believed that their children should see the value of helping other human beings for no other reason than just to help. Therefore, my brother and I have been attending monthly volunteer projects since before we could remember. One of my earliest memories includes standing on top of an empty banana crate just so that I could reach over the table to help hand out bread at Haven for Hope, a homeless shelter in San Antonio. Although I have helped out at these projects since I was a young child, I never truly understood the importance of what I was doing. I simply saw the projects as a fun way to spend my Saturday afternoon with my family. However, that changed after the St. PJs' project.
I love my parents. I have been blessed with parents that love me unconditionally and are able to provide for me. They’ve worked so hard to give me a better life than they experienced when they were young. A better life of living, better education, and a lot of love. They were very determined and through all their perseverance made it in America. My mom was born on December 3rd, 1967 She grew up in Baghdad, Iraq. When my mom was growing up she was relatively safe. She lived with her grandma, grandpa, uncles, and aunts for most of her life in one house. She didn’t have privacy or her own room since she lived in a crowded house. Her dad wasn’t in her life. The time she saw her dad was at age 6. Her dad was always a busy man. He’d been working in Saudi Arabia for 9 years trying to make good money. When living in that house my mom was trained from an early age to learn how to clean and cook. She couldn’t play outside unless there was a guardian watching her whilst having a curfew. When going to school she had to walk to each of her schools from elementary to high school. The schooling system had a mix of boys and girls this was up until 7th grade; when the schools separated the b
“I am smart. I am smart. I am smart” I repeat to myself over and over again. It is my mantra. It is what has always defined me. My intelligence. My wit. My entire sense of self worth has come from the validation I have received by being told that I am smart, I didn’t even have to work for it. I just was.
I am one of 6 kids, growing up everything felt like a competition. Who was the best behaved? Who helped the most around the house? Who was the best at mario party? Who was the best at singing? It all felt like one massive triathlon, with the grand prize being attention. I quickly ruled myself out of most of those competitions, but the one thing I decided I could stand my ground in was the smart competition, so I chose that one to focus my energy on. I didn’t care that I wasn’t the most athletic in my family, or the funniest, or that I wasn’t the best at singing. I cared about the “who was the smartest” competition. I made the right choice. I got all the praise and affirmation I could ever need because of this. Ever since I was little, I was in the gifted program; I always had the most A.R. points; I always had the best grades. The adults around me went crazy, fawning and preening over the little “genius” they had in their midst. The constant praise I got from the adults in my life, for doing what was for me the bare minimum, became my everything. They told me the info that came to me naturally and that my love of reading made me different from all the rest. That I was worthy because of my intelligence and it consumed me. Even as young as elementary school, grades were what I cared about. I would compare the grades on different assignments with the other kids in my class, and because I was always on top there I moved on the the next rung of the ladder: the other kids in the gifted and talented program. I was placed there because I did well on a test. A test I took at 5 years old determined where I was in comparison to other students. A single test, that determined my courses at that school, told me that I was better than the other kids, that I was smart. I thought tests were awesome after that; they were the repeated affirmation that I was smart. As I got older, the other kids caught up. I came to realize that I wasn’t smarter than them, or at least not to the degree I had previously believed. There are many other kids who were able to get straight A’s. There was always the nagging voice in the back of my head though, telling me I needed to be just slightly smarter than them. It was a new competition, with more, stronger players. I believe it was around there, around 5th grade that my grades, the score of how smart I am, the score of my value as a person, became an obsession. I was always told my grades were the key to my future. My parents are immigrants. Education. Is. Everything. I needed good grades to get into a good high school. And I needed good grades at that good high school to go to a good college. And I would, of course, need good grades at that good college to have a good future.These kind of thoughts fed into my frenzy. The stakes of my game have gotten higher. I checked my grades obsessively, to verify that I was, in fact, still smart, to the point that I was staring at them at least 7 times a day. I wouldn’t want to fall behind now, would I? Being placed in a regular level class, when honors was an option, was unacceptable. I don’t know why others couldn’t see that as clearly as I did. I continued throughout middle school that way, and high school came in a blur. In high school, in addition to being smart, I decided to try my hand at being a model student. I took the hardest classes I could get my hands on. All APs please. I also did as many extracurriculars as possible. 3 sports a year, plus so many clubs, that honestly I don’t even think I remember them all well enough to rattle them off. There would be days where I would be here, at TMI, for over 14 hours, 6 am to 8:30 pm. I quite literally lived here. I mean I was here more than I was at my house. On top of that I was having to do all my homework for the classes I chose to take once I got home. Afterall, I couldn’t have any teacher thinking of me as anything less than a perfect student, and a late assignment would most definitely qualify as being less than perfect. It. was. Exhausting. I was drained. For months at a time I would just do school, collapse, and repeat. I didn’t have energy to talk to my friends. I didn’t have energy for my family. 
Waking up to the sound of birds with the sun shining through the trees suddenly turns into the sound of construction and massive buildings blocking the light and casting a gloomy shadow into my room. The mountain I grew up on where you could drive for miles only seeing nature suddenly became driving through traffic with skyscrapers surrounding the view. For most of my life I grew up in Waynesville, North Carolina. It was a town where there wasn't much to go and do,  but there was a lot to see. The school I attended was small, and there wasn't much to do besides go to the youth center that would be open for kids after school. Having my friends live right around the corner, most of the time I spent with them was at the youth center or one of our houses. This all changed when I found out we would be moving out of Waynesville after I lived there for the past seven years. My family told my sisters and I we would be moving to the city of Charlotte, which was a very different environment that I was not used to. It was hard leaving the place I had grown up in for so long, but I was glad to be able to experience something new. Leaving the friends I grew up with and the place I called home wasn't easy in the slightest. Arriving in Charlotte, the first few months were hard getting used to the environment and making friends in the middle of the year, but over time adapting to this new life got a lot easier. There was a lot more to do and see. If I wanted to go see a movie in Waynesville, it was about a twenty minute drive. In Charlotte, it was five minutes away.  It was shocking with the variety of things you could do within a ten minute drive. I went to get hibachi for the first time there and ever since then I have gone every year for my birthday as a tradition. My sister having her fencing practices ten minutes away, for about a year everyday after school I would have to go with her and wait. Instead of doing my schoolwork, I would mainly mess around in the gym that they had. Over time I grew interested and eventually started going to practice with her. After the countless times I would trash talk her, I was quickly humbled after going a not so fair 0-15 against
Picture yourself in your most restful state. Are you watching your favorite movie? Eating your favorite meal? Growing up, mine was anytime my head hit a pillow. This was partially because I was always growing, but it was mostly due to my busy schedule. Since 6th grade, my life revolved around beach volleyball. After long practices in the hot sand, taking a shower and getting into bed was the best feeling in the world. Though I frequently felt drained, I became accustomed to this routine: school, practice, sleep, repeat. I even transferred to online school freshman year to focus on training. This transition also gave me the time I needed to rest. As an introvert, I loved the ability to sit at home all day. I spent ninety percent of my time alone with only my parents and sisters to talk to. As time progressed, though, things shifted. A few months into online school, my family went through some changes. My sisters, mom and I moved out of our house and adapted to a new lifestyle. Initially, I responded poorly. I started making excuses for why I couldn’t go to practice or why I wasn’t turning in my work on time, because I could. I took advantage of the changes my family and I were going through. As a result, my passion for volleyball began to drift, and my overall motivation depleted. 
I spent day after day doing what I used to look forward to: resting with my head on a pillow. I didn’t realize how bad this was at the time, though. However, my mom used her mother's instinct and saw this much more apparently than I did. She informed our relatives of our situation, and my aunt drove down from Dallas despite her and my uncle’s upcoming plan: a hiking trip to Utah With both my mom and aunt having a mother’s instinct, they made an arrangement so my twin sister and I could join my aunt and uncle on this unexpected getaway. 
As I scanned through images of Zion National Park on my phone, I couldn’t help but have an ounce of dread as I imagined climbing rocks in the heat for days on end. I was at a place in which sleeping seemed the only suitable thing to do. But of course, I was excited and grateful for this trip. I was also full of anticipation. Having a mom who plans trips a year in advance, the spontaneity of it all was a completely new experience. Less than seventy-two hours later, I was on a plane to a place I had never heard of before. Seeming as though time wanted to test my patience, our flight was delayed three hours. In the meantime, my sister, aunt and I found a cozy spot on the floor. I spent some time on my phone, but I quickly got tired of repeatedly scrolling through social media. As I sat completely bored, I glanced over my shoulder to notice my aunt reading a thriller novel. Up until that point, I hadn’t considered myself a reader. I had tried reading here and there, but besides competing in Battle of the Books in second grade, I had never given it a real chance. I asked my aunt some questions about what she was reading, and, seeing my curiosity, she offered me a novel to read on her kindle. I was immediately sucked in. Before I knew it, it was time to board our final plane. We landed, met up with my uncle, hopped in the rental car, and headed towards Zion. Though I have seen mountains several times throughout my life, such as the ones in El Paso, I was in awe of this new landscape. Rocks of every shade of red and orange stretched as far as I could see. As the sun set, the colors became vibrant, and I couldn’t take enough pictures. Though I have raging car sickness, I felt completely calm. We eventually parked, headed to our hotel room, and recharged for our early morning. We woke to our alarm at four a.m.; We aimed to beat the heat for the majority of our first hike called  “Angels Landing”. I was not naturally a morning person. Waking up early felt like torture most days. However, I hopped out of bed much quicker this time. Though I was drowsy as I ate breakfast and changed clothes, there was a positive energy about the early morning.
My favorite song lyrics come from a well-known Brazilian Bossa, Desde Que o Samba é Samba by Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. The lyrics in Portuguese “Solidão apavora. Tudo demorando em ser tão ruim. Mas alguma coisa acontece no quando agora em mim. Cantando eu mando a tristeza embora.” For those who don’t understand Portuguese, these song lyrics approximately translate to: “The loneliness terrifies; The worst is yet to come; But something presently happens in me; By singing, I send the sadness away”. The meaning behind this musical poem is simplistic but memorable. The two songwriters wrote this song as an ode to their love for samba and the joy and comfort that they find from the music that makes all the loneliness and sadness in the world melt away.Although the English translation may not have been grammatically accurate, I find that the Portuguese verbiage is perfect just the way it is. For a long time, I was unsure of my identity. My legal identity has always been that I am a white Latina Brazilian-American with a pinch of Spanish ancestry from my Grandma’s side. My parents were both born and raised in Brazil, much like most of my family members; however, unlike the rest of my family, my parents’ plan for after they married was to move to the US for just a few years to finish up college and grad school and then to move back to Brazil to the comfort of their family. Funnily enough, the last bit of that plan never ended up happening, and a few years later, I was born here in Texas, destined to live the rest of my life as a fully-fledged American citizen. When I was starting to form words and speak back to my parents in fragmented baby sentences, the only language I would speak was Portuguese. My parents, who were still in the process of learning English at the time, would only speak Portuguese to me when they were home. On top of that, my vovó, (which means grandma in Portuguese) who didn’t speak a single word of English, took care of me for almost a year while my parents were working, so it wasn’t too surprising that English became my second language. Although I am much more comfortable speaking English now, I wish my parents had forced me a little more to keep up my Portuguese. The more I learned English in school, the less I was able to remember the almost perfect Portuguese I used to speak. Out of the house, there were barely any Portuguese speakers around me, so the way to ‘fit in’ was for me to learn English. This not only made my parents a bit disappointed, but also began my journey into the wormhole that was my identity. As I entered elementary school, there were a few surprises I encountered. Every year till approximately the 4th grade, when my peers were all bragging about our cultures and our parent’s origins, at least one person in my class would beg me, the only person of Brazilian ancestry in the school, to speak Portuguese for them as if it were a mysteriously enchanting alien language. Every time, without fail, I would proudly speak a sentence or two and amaze my classmates. I would say something along the lines of "Você não pode me entender, então posso dizer coisas malucas como você é burro como um jacaré.” They would ooh and aww to the sound of my silly sentences and would then bombard me with questions about my origins. Although I took pride in showing off my culture to my uneducated peers, I always felt a sort of anxiety about discussing my knowledge as I did not feel like a certified enough Brazilian to talk about the country and language. My quiet nature certainly didn’t help this original anxiety and over time I stopped talking about my culture entirely. Many of even my closest friends would mistake me for being Mexican or Colombian and through gritted teeth, I would h
Rome was not built in a day, and neither is any civilization. Humankind, or Homo Sapiens, or Cro Magnons, or whatever you would like to call us, have been around for about sixty-thousand years. We started out as what we might refer to as “cavemen”, but, slowly but surely, over the course of sixty-thousand years, managed to invent vaccines and supercomputers, master both sea and sky, and spread ourselves and our parking lots over nearly every corner of the Earth. So the question, then, is how? What exactly is it that turned a bunch of primates in a cave into a bunch of primates in a Whataburger parking lot? How did we get here?
One answer is fire, or the campfire, to be more specific. The campfire is something I believe almost everyone has experienced at least once. I certainly have on many occasions: whether when living with my outdoorsy grandparents in Montana during the summers, or camping in the Pennsylvania woods with my friends from my hometown of Pittsburgh, or when simply doing my best to survive my fellow eighth graders on our end of year class trip. It seems that whenever humans exist in their natural habitat, which, mind you, was, for the better part of sixty-thousand years, the great outdoors, they find themselves, at the end of the day, around a fire with other humans. The light which fire gives in the darkness and the warmth which it provides are partially responsible for this, but we also gather around the fire for food. Humans have an extreme preference for cooked foods. And so humans were and are brought together around the single social focal point of the fire in order to cook and to eat. I may have hunted and gathered marshmallows, chocolate and graham crackers at my local Walmart on the way back from capsizing six times on the Missouri river, and Prehistoric Smith may have hunted a wild hare for hours on end, but at the end of the day, both of us must gather ‘round the campfire in order to prepare our hard-won bounties. And as long as everybody’s gathered ‘round the campfire, we’ll sing our campfire songs. That’s exactly what happens today, and it's exactly what happened way back in Prehistoric Smith’s day and age.
Humans would, as they now do, tell each other stories. They began by telling stories about what they did that day. About the bird they saw or the ankle they sprained. But as time wore on, as their stories became more complex, and as language itself developed as a means of telling stories, they told a greater variety of stories, and told them more artistically. And some stories were worth remembering. Some were worth passing on.
And so, if we return to the beginnings of the existence of humans, we find small bands of no more than fifty people, and each band of people with a dedicated storyteller. This storyteller tells stories about the world. Mythical stories, but they contain important lessons: which berries were safe to eat, how to hunt deer, when the tides come in. As the agricultural revolution occurs, they pass down the knowledge of how to cultivate crops.
The storyteller is the very beginning of collective human knowledge. The information they pass on is the beginning of agriculture, medicine, science, math, history, and academia. Their authority is the beginning of government, their judgements the beginning of law, and their deliberations the beginning of philosophy. Their word choice is the beginning of poetry, their visual aides the beginning of art, and their sound effects the beginning of music. The attempt to record them is the beginning of literature. Anything which is not hunting, gathering, or child-rearing is birthed from the storyteller. Civilization is birthed from the storyteller.
And that is ultimately why it is us, and not the orangutans who stand in the Whataburger parking lot. We, unlike any living organisms we yet know of, tell stories. Stories are a human thing. They define us: they define us as a species, but they also define the individual people and cultures who tell them. Peoples are reflected in the stories they choose to tell; the classical Greeks are reflected in the Iliad of Homer, the Romans in the Odes of Horace, and we ourselves in Star Wars, whether we like it or not. We find, in the differences between our stories, the diversity of humankind. But just as often, we find similarities, even universalities. Still today, in our own literature, we can find Dante’s Inferno, and the legends of King Arthur, repeated and echoed and told again and again by individuals, all unique in their own right and yet entirely, universally human.
As that which defines us, stories are things which we cannot afford to lose. In an age and a society in which there are no more campfires, in which we live not among tribes or clans, but among neighbors with whom we never speak, and in which social media not only allows, and not only facilitates, but indeed enforces selective listening, we all have the potential to lose the stories which we ought to hear. In so doing, we may lose what makes us human.
No where, and at no time, was this made more apparent to me than when I moved to Texas just before sixth grade. I had hitherto lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a very liberal city in a fairly liberal state in one of the most liberal regions of the country. I was although a kid, a very liberal kid, and identified as a Democrat, which I still do to this day. So did nearly everyone else I knew in Pittsburgh. Then I moved to Texas, and became a speck of blue in a sea of red. I learned quickly to hide my politics, as divulging them would lead to me having to fend off the entire lunch table, and could even threaten friendships. I had one friend at TMI, who, after three years of friendship, eventually found out I was a Democrat and said, “Oh. I don’t think we can be friends anymore.” But, to this day, we still are friends. We still are friends because I, a Democrat,
