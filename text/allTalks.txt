I am an optimist. I like to look on the bright side of things whenever I can. Whenever I am down I reset my thoughts by saying “it is what it is” and look for solutions. Now, this last year tended to be a very “It is what it is” kind of year, but I found that that is the exact thing I needed to say. With little control over our current situation I tried to make the best of the worst conditions. I worked to have fun and enjoy my junior year and make it my best year yet. And with my new attitude and new friends I had the time of my life. To give you an idea of what was upcoming for me I will give you the general overview. I was going to C dorm as the prefect that year. For me, C was like a Found family comedy like Friends or How I Met your Mother in which the cast would always get into some sort of crazy scenario and end up closer because of it. Because of this I will set the cast and stage so you can see from my point of view. Coming with me were two sophomores (Ryan and Flint), another junior (Matthew), and our one senior, (Joey) who was in C dorm previous years.  We all lived in C and it was one of the older dorms that had lots of faults that weren’t present in the new dorms. But no matter its faults and issues, C dorm made up for it in character and memories. Now that you have the general overview, let's begin. Despite having to go through quarantine before, I did not realize the extent to which quarantine meant in the dorms. Although I and the other Junior Matthew had cars, we were not allowed to leave at all. In fact, visits outside of our dorm became much more of a hassle because each house was declared its own “unit” and had to stick with their own. Now I am not saying that these rules were unjust, but they did make everything more - difficult. To start, our food situation wasn’t ideal. We would have food dropped off in our common room for us for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and the only constant was the poor quality food. We had the saddest chicken for breakfast and lunch most every day with equally awful dinners. But we knew that the quality wouldn’t change on its own so we took up the challenge to fix it. Armed with a hot plate and a simple Chef’s Knife, our master chef Flint would take control of the kitchen. At first it started by recooking the pork in the pork tacos and adding spices and other toppings, but it soon evolved to his specialty Chicken Sandwich. He would sear the chicken with a hot plate to give it a solid crust and he would make his own cane’s sauce. Combined with some toasted bread and smuggled vegetables, we are left with a pleasant sandwich.  We would do this for nearly every meal that we could fix as even though we couldn’t do much, we did what we could with what we were dealt. But not every meal could be fixed. Enter the enchiladas verdes. Although ideas popped up about a potential solution, we realized that some things can’t be fixed. And although nothing could directly fix it, we had prepared for this as we knew that somethings must start anew. Beforehand we went to the store and bought some steak, spinach, and other ingredients for our meal. With our three New York Strips in the freezer and hot plate on, with supervision, we started our feast. Accompanied by the delicate comedy of Southpark and by each other, we were happy. It didn’t matter that we were stuck or why we were stuck, we were happy. This “it is what it is” outlook soon spread to every aspect of our lives. We realized that we may not have had our conventional resources, but we had what we had. We had a group of very different people with various backgrounds and personalities and a Computer and occasional trips to target. So we did what we could with what we had. After classes in online school, we would often go out to the hall and stretch so then we could sit down and watch Southpark or some trash show on the History network. When we had classes together we would go outside and sit with one another. No more Friday movie trips? No problem! We set up our own movie night watching all sorts of movies like Parasite and Bruno. We then added game night playing Dark Souls, Smash Bros., and Undertale. We then ventured into horror games like Dead Space 3 and DDLC. This then led to each of us leading our own journeys. Joey would bring us deep into the Chinese version of Youtube being our tour guide to all the inside jokes. Matthew would lead us on our dorm repair with his janky ideas of “fixed” like paper shadings for hallway lights and a shower curtain as a doorway. The aforementioned Flint would contrast my optimism with his pessimism, cook, and show us his favorite absurdist Australian comedians. And Ryan would sit in his room and do Math homework. Meanwhile I was there watching it all and “supervising” where needed and egging on when I saw the opportunities for a stable level of chaos. Hair cuts? Well we got a $40 razer from Target and five boys giving their ideas of what looks “right”. No more going out for events? Well we have two full water bottles, cardboard boxes, and a hallway so we made a crude one on one bowling game. Every problem we faced we kept our chin up and figured out a solution or workaround. However, there is one problem I couldn’t fix. One Catastrophe that we can’t wait out. The Freeze. Through the night the snow gathered and gathered, and when we awoke it was piled up to amounts TMI hadn’t seen for some time. We had the privilege to see TMI under all that snow and it was amazing. My dorm all ventured out into the snow and we went as far as the lacrosse field. Although I complained of the temperature and my fingers freezing off for the whole time, I enjoyed it and thought it would be another memory dedicated to C Dorm. But when we got back, everything got worse. Our power went out and the temperature started going down. The apartment was below freezing and the common room was about 45 degrees. Although the option of going to a newer dorm was presented, we stuck together and bundled up in the common room watching a show on a laptop, weathering the storm. Spirits were still high despite the fact that temperature was low. We were dealing with our problems as well as we could while keeping a positive outlook but then everything came falling down, literally. We soon got told to evacuate the building as a portion of one of the other old dorms had collapsed along with the ceramics building due to freezing pipes and water troubles. But no matter the issue, we had to get out. All I could take was my backpack with my laptop and a few sets of clothes. We evacuated to Ewing, one of the relatively newer dorms, and set down our stuff. Once we settled in and calmed down, we were ready to assess our situation. Suddenly, a pipe burst right outside our room in the hallway. I grabbed my bags once more as water was filling the room and moved to Abbot this time. To say my optimism was still at 100% would be lying. I was on the verge of freaking out, keeping my composure just till I was alone. But to my surprise, Flint, our local pessimist, was doing what I couldn't. He remembered our backup steak that we had marinating in the C Freezer and started cooking it outside. He knew that everything was finally going the pessimistic route where nothing went right, but he made the best of the situation. He was standing outside in the below freezing weather and handing out pieces of our rainy day meal to whoever needed it. And then I realized how important this mindset is. Maybe Flint was just coping in his own way and doing what he was good at and enjoyed, but more to my point he knew what would make anything better. He acted in a way that improved all of our situations even if it wasn’t much. He did what he could and that is more than I can say for myself. With the snow melting and being able to return to my home in South Texas I had time to think about the situation. Time passed and I returned to Abbot after Spring break. With Ewing fixed, the Ewing kids could go back to their dorm, but the same could not be said for C dorm. My precious dorm was unsalvageable with water problems being found in the main dorm and more urgent water concerns in Dr. Leport’s apartment. Of course I was devastated but I knew that nothing could be done to save the building. I saw that we had the same people and the same opportunities for goofing off but still it was hard to lose such an important figure for us. As of my last quarter of Junior year, I am still in Abbot. We have grieved and are forced to face that it is what it is. My dorm is now an empty lot and some of us even got to observe it’s demolition. Our community had moved to Abbot but it wasn’t the same and nothing we could do would make it the same. We had caught lightning in a bottle and now it was gone. We still honor the dorm with each of us taking our own keepsakes of C dorm. I claimed a non working clock with algebra instead of numbers and a fire alarm. Others took photos and their own piece of the building. I even printed some vinyl stickers that say “mini C” to put on our dorm. Despite all this, we have recovered what we could. We aren’t the same group, but when Dr. Leport comes for dinner, we all sit around as a Dorm once again to chat and banter. We started to pick ourselves up again and returned to our mindset of “it is what it is” and started doing what we could to stay together. We go get fastfood and tailgate. We eat together during lunch and during all of our outings. There is still a bond that can’t be broken by a freeze. Now after all of this sorrow I recognize how important that attitude is. We could have gotten brought down by the pandemic and everyone that goes with it, the boredom, the loneliness, the sameness of everything, but we lasted. Our attitude of gratitude kept us upbeat and led to some of the best memories I have ever had. Poker nights while watching every single Twilight movie and the stupid mind games that came with it. Playing with the VR and cracking jokes while someone was cutting bullets in slow mo. Our showing of Parasite got too popular and had to be interrupted because too many of the other dormers were watching with us instead of going to community night. Even the times when I would have to climb a window or crouch down in a too small shower feel nostalgic because of my attitude. No matter the problem, our attitude made it better. We said “it is what it is” and got through everything and forged a bond that will last and be remembered. Whenever you face hardships, think back to what you can do to make your situation better. And if you need a starting point, I will tell you of the knowledge passed on to me by Joey, our oldest and wisest roommate. Putting dinosaur stickers on everything makes the world a bit better. Thank You.  
Throughout my life, I have been given many different names. These include “little Kyle”, “the youngest Kyle”, “the last of the Kyles”, “the baby of the family”. I have even been called “pipsqueak”, a name first given to me by my aunt, but then so lovingly adopted by my oldest brother, more based on the fact that I am the shortest out of my siblings than the youngest, but a name that I have been referred to as nonetheless. The majority of my life has been based on my three older siblings. I have gone to the same schools as them, taken the same classes, played the same sports, and tried all of the same hobbies. This led me to being a very annoying little sister, which I have unfortunately always been aware of thanks to one of my brothers. For the most part though, my siblings have been very accepting of my constant desire to tag along and ask incessant questions, even when seeking their acceptance has led to major regret and quite a bit of crying. As a kid I would get scared very easily. That’s not to say that I don't anymore, but it is not nearly as bad as having nightmares about the movies Jaws and Gremlins for months after watching them. My sister was forced to deal with my constant paranoia before falling asleep every night during those periods considering we shared a bedroom for the majority of my life. However, I was always convinced that I would be able to make it through the same scary things as the rest of my family. Hence why when my parents brought up the idea of going to the haunted house, "The Nightmare on Elm Street," I attempted to convince everyone else of my bravery. Keep in mind, I was eight. There was no sign that I would be able to successfully make it through a haunted house. I could barely even handle playing "Call of Duty'' because I got startled by other players coming around a corner in front of me. Despite this, I had far too much faith in myself. My siblings knew better. They remembered my fear more clearly than I had, but I insisted that this time it would somehow be different. I am still unsure why anyone thought to even consider letting four children into a haunted house like that. Given that there are at least ratings on movies, I would have expected some sort of age limit, preferably one that was higher than eight. For some reason though, my parents caved in and bought the tickets. It was possibly thanks to what I would like to call my “youngest child charm,” also known as annoying my entire family and begging until my parents said okay. Throughout the time leading up to our trip, I continued to convince myself of how brave I was going to be. I rehearsed methods of how to get past each room involving remembering that each of the monsters was just a regular person determined to make their customers feel immensely uncomfortable, a truly wonderful job description. I had no idea what to expect from this experience though because the closest that I had come to a haunted house was the Phineas and Ferb Halloween special where they build a giant haunted house to cure Isabella’s hiccups. Needless to say, my expectations for how scary it would be were very low. There was no need to think about all of the times that I had failed to watch a semi-scary movie without covering my eyes or plugging my ears at certain points. Those were all two dimensional as well, which is completely different from an in-person experience that would definitely not be more immersive, and realistic, and terrifying. The point is that I am almost certain that I had subconsciously blocked any movie that gave me nightmares as a kid from my memory so as to convince myself that I would be prepared for what was to come. On the day that we were supposed to finally go to “The Nightmare on Elm Street” I was excited to be able to prove myself to my siblings. They could no longer make fun of me for getting frightened far too easily because I would have endured the same terrors as they had. But when the site of the attraction came into view, my confidence began to dwindle. From what I remember, the building towered over the crowds of people waiting in lines to meet their doom. Every crack and chip in the rickety, old home was illuminated by an ominous, red glow. The entrance was clouded by a thick fog, and as we moved closer I could hear the eerie music grow louder and louder in my ears along with my quickened heartbeat.  While we joined the line to venture inside, the building loomed before me. It threatened my new reputation that I was building. I could not let a measly haunted house take me down, so I stood as tall as my eight year old frame would allow and plastered a smile onto my face. As we approached the entrance, the realization of my mistake flooded into my head. My siblings knew better. I was completely unprepared, and yet I could not bring myself to admit my defeat just yet. I clutched my parents as any anxious child would do while entering a new mildly terrifying environment. It was dark. The scent of artificial fog filled my nostrils, and before I knew it, the sudden crashes and bangs coupled with seemingly ten foot tall monsters jumping towards me out of the shadows broke down every ounce of strength I had in me. I immediately began to shriek, and cry, and bury my face in my mom’s shirt to avoid moving forward. I am not  proud of that reaction, but I would personally say that it is completely justifiable considering my age at the time. The rest of the haunted house was a blur thanks to the pure fear that I was feeling, but I do remember my family trying to protect me from the actors that were simply doing their job as we hurried towards the exit. When we finally emerged into the street that we entered from, tears were streaming down my face. I had cut our experience there short, but no one seemed angry or disappointed. Rather, my siblings comforted me with the fact that nothing would be jumping out and grabbing at me for the rest of the night. I was assured that I was safe and would soon be back in our car, and eventually wrapped up in my bed a few feet from my sister. Before our night came to a close, we collectively decided that the best plan of action would be to stop at Baskin Robbins to help soothe the emotional damage. My face was still hot from embarrassment and fear while dragging my feet towards the case to browse my options, and yet, swept up in the endless flavor options, I momentarily forgot the horrors that I had just experienced. I tasted a couple delightful flavors before making my final decision. I ate my ice cream slowly, both because I decided to use the tiny tasting spoon from earlier and because I still felt weighed down by the guilt that I was the main reason my siblings were forced to rush through the haunted house’s thrills. After all, they were able to predict the outcome before my parents had even bought the tickets, yet they put my feelings above their own. I won’t lie, the ice cream helped quite a bit. It usually does. However, my siblings also helped even though they could have easily ignored me for the rest of the night or blamed me for an unsatisfactory experience at their first real haunted house. When I look back past all of our complaining about each other, My siblings have spent quite a bit of time helping me when I asked for it. Some have been more useful and kind about it than others, but they each have their moments. They have dealt with my stubbornness when I don’t understand homework despite likely wanting to yell at me and leave me to struggle on my own. They’re all willing to answer my questions about past experiences in classes no matter how many times I go back to interrupt whatever they were doing. We do not talk with each other a lot, even when we are all home, but I appreciate the fact that they are all still willing to have conversations with me when I am struggling to figure out my plans. This takes a level of empathy that I feel needs to be included in my aspirations to be like all of them. The fact that we have all had so many of the same experiences means that they understand my feelings better than most others. I will always be “little Kyle” to those that knew my siblings before meeting me, but I do not mind this comparison nearly as much as I used to make it seem like I did. I still want to paint and draw as well as my sister. I still want to have as clear of an idea for my future as my oldest brother. I still want to be as strong as my other brother. They each have many admirable 
I was 13 years old when my father decided to walk out of my life. If I am being honest, he had left my family long before he physically walked out the door. You learn quickly when bad things like this happen, it is either learn to cope or decide to cave. When my father left I think I did both. Facing the music of my reality, there was a lot of crying and letting little things get to me. Luckily, I like roller coasters so this ride of emotion called “cold reality” was starting to hit home. In today’s world, “coping” is an often used buzzword but I don’t think most of us grasp the true meaning of “coping.”  For those who don’t know what coping is let me give you the dictionary definition:   “to deal effectively with something difficult.” True coping requires more than just “dealing” with it, you need to do it effectively and it became clear pretty quickly I didn’t understand that part of it. ​To “cope” with his leaving I turned to video games and sleeping. When I played games it took me to a different world, a world where I did not have to deal with the thoughts and feelings I had about my situation at hand. However, because of this, my grades reflected this unhealthy coping method. My grades were dropping and the mask I put on at school was starting to slip off. Sadly I didn’t make any changes and my future is affected because of my inability to realize that I was not really coping. Yes, video games are fun and made me feel better, but all it was doing was keeping me occupied until I turned the video games off and those thoughts and feelings I thought I was handling reared their ugly head again. It became clear I was only escaping what I needed to face. Another mechanism I thought was coping was just avoiding anything that had to do with my father. It seemed easier than trying to explain our strange and new family dynamic.  As terrible as it seemed for this to happen 3 days before Thanksgiving, I was kind of thankful it surrounded a holiday because I didn’t have to see anyone. I didn’t have to explain I wasn’t with my parents or why my mom was so sad or why I didn’t want to get out of bed.   Even now, anytime I have a conversation with him as the topic I get physically uncomfortable and I feel sick. I am a work in progress. Healthy coping is when there is a positive outcome and you have positive relationships. I put on a facade so I wouldn’t have to talk about it, to anyone. As it turns out, that wasn’t coping, that was avoidance.  I was struggling in school; I wasn’t progressing in the Corps; and I was separating myself from my friends.  Then we had a Pandemic.  Each of us has a “Covid” story.  Covid was in some way a great outlet for me because it allowed me to further isolate.  School as we knew it ended.  The world shut down but no one understood my world had already closed its borders.  School finally “resumed” virtually but Zoom classes were not my friend.  It turns out, even an introvert needs people. It was still easier for me to hide. I did not excel.  I failed to turn in assignments I had actually completed.  I took naps during lunch instead of eating and was frequently late for class.  At one point, one of my teachers finally realized something was off because I had failed to turn on my camera after being asked many times. I did not want to be seen.  Luckily, he held me accountable and I couldn’t hide anymore.  In hindsight, it was a gift, but I still failed to communicate my circumstances. I knew I wasn’t the only person at TMI to experience divorce.  Although, I can say, my circumstances were like a script for a tragic movie.  While other kids of divorce were juggling life and seeing parents on alternate weekends, and how to navigate holidays, I was trying to steer my way through my father calling the police because I did not want to go with him. There still wasn’t a clear gauge of how to cope. There’s not enough time to explain everything my mom and I endured but it seemed too far surpass what the majority of my peers faced with divorce. At one point my mom finally said, “Everyone has struggles,” and if you know my mom, it’s easy to envision what that sounded like.  It wasn’t minimizing my sadness but it reminded me that I wasn’t alone.  My circumstances may have been unique but struggling wasn’t specific to me.  There it was again, the theme:  cope or cave.  Caving obviously wasn’t working. That summer I read a book by Mark Manson with a questionable title but a perfect message:  “Don’t hope for a life without problems…There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.” ​My problem still wasn’t “good” but it was manageable.  Somewhere in the midst of all my struggles, my life began to change into something positive.  My mom met a man who made us a family again.  I call him “Step-Doug.”  My world changed from, “I was 13 when my father walked out of my life,” to “I was 14 when I met my dad.” Step-Doug said to me early on, “Stick with me kid, I’ll give you a better life.”  Sure, I still had problems but they were better problems. ​There is a lot I learned from my situation and how we really need to help others and cope.  Firstly, don’t assume you know someone’s narrative.  Not everyone knows how to express their trauma or how to cope with it.  For those that thought I was failing, every day I made it to school, I had already climbed out of a hole to get here.   In the words of Mark Manson, “You can’t be an important and life-changing presence for some people without also being a joke and an embarrassment to others.” I may have seemed like the latter to some but I would eventually find myself again.  And if something seems off with someone, simply ask, “are you ok?,” because it could make a world of difference. Coping is to “deal effectively with something difficult.”  I am still learning how to put this into action but each day is a new opportunity.  We are all artists of our own stress and anxiety and sometimes the piece we keep picking up we’re simply putting in the wrong place.  I learned recently that the motto and my mom’s family crest is:  Dum Spiro Spero which means, “while I breathe I hope.”  Never give up hope. 
Life is like a beast, always moving, changing, and growing, but it will devour you if you don’t keep up with it. An interpretation of Charles Darwin once said, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.” Let me say that again, it is not the strongest or smartest who survive, but those who can adapt.  We all have this in common, at some point we will all have to face adversity in some form or another. In this interpretation, survivors don’t power through it or outthink it, they adapt to it to win.  We all wish there was some way to hit the pause button on life and maybe even a cheat code around the hardest parts, but they don’t exist. There is no way to stop life from going forward, no matter what someone may go through, we as people need to be able to adapt to survive. As you can probably guess, lacrosse has taught me a lot about life. If you do not know, lacrosse is a full-contact sport that requires you to drive through the defenders to get a goal.  Sometimes you dodge, sometimes you dive, and most times you get hit.  Everyone who has played lacrosse with me knows that I am known for getting hit. Hit pretty hard in fact. So hard, they gave me a nickname: Gumby. That name is not because I get hit hard though.  It’s because no matter how hard, I still get up. I do this because what is the point of staying on the ground? If I have not suffered a severe injury, why stay down? Either way, the game will go on without me and I am not helping my team if they are worried. I must be flexible toward the situation and get up. Not only will this show that I can go back into play, but it will let my teammates know that I am okay. More than that, with every hit I learn something about my competitor. While every hit will be different, each one teaches me how to adapt to their defense, their style of play, and their athletic ability. Much like life,  lacrosse will have hits that come quickly and out of nowhere. The only way to bounce back is to get up and keep playing the game. Learn from each “hit” and adapt your game, your strategy, and your life to win. I have not only learned adaptability from being hit (and, of course getting back up) on the lacrosse field, but I have also learned the importance of adaptability from times when we were losing. A great example of this is when TMI Lacrosse played against Reagan last season.  You may not know this, but last year they were a division ahead of us and favored to win. In the first half of the first quarter, they were able to score four clean goals on us. We were playing awfully. Not only could we not clear the ball, but we couldn’t even hold it on offense if we tried. The whole team was making mistakes, myself included. It was getting to the point where it would be hard to come back. I called a timeout so we could figure out what we were doing wrong, slow the game down, and find their weaknesses. The team and I took a breath and came together to see what we had learned. With this, our team was able to adapt to the circumstances.  We could adapt to the situation and overcome the problems that people had. How did that work for us?  Right off the bat, we were able to score a goal. Then on Reagan’s next offensive possession, we were able to stop them from scoring. We adapted to their style of play and got back up from that big 4 goal “hit.” This adaptation gave us what we needed to go on a non-stop scoring spree. We won that game… by a lot! When situations are looking rough the only way to fix them is to slow down, observe your surroundings, and then act upon them and adapt. Even when I was young I had to learn how to adapt. When I was about 5 years old I lived in Red Bank, New Jersey. For those of you that don’t know New Jersey, Red Bank is at the Jersey Shore.  Most days I could smell the ocean as I rode my bike to school. My brothers and I didn’t play lacrosse in New Jersey.  Our sport was racing sailboats and on weekends we were on the beach. Then, we moved to Waco Texas. [Dramatic pause here] This is before “Fixer Upper” Waco Texas. It wasn’t exactly the change of situations that I had to get used to, it was more a change of cultures. I went from sailing boats on saltwater to Mutton Busting in the Heart of Texas rodeo. Everything was somewhat different and new. Instead of finding reasons to be upset, I found ways to excel in the new environment. I put away my sailboat and took up baseball and travel team soccer.  I learned how to properly wear boots and a cowboy hat.  In short, I embraced this new culture and adapted to our new situation. This showed me the importance of being able to change to a better self. If I complained about being in Texas and away from my friends and family I would have gotten nowhere. It is simple things like this that made me learn if I am unable to be flexible with the obstacles that come my way, I will never see success. In other words, I’ve been Gumby long before I got to TMI. So you have heard about me in my life and on the playing field, however, there are plenty of examples of other people adapting to a situation and turning it into an opportunity. One great example of this is Spencer Silver. Spencer worked in a lab at 3M Corporation and was in charge of creating a strong adhesive. Try as he might, Spencer could not make his adhesive strong enough to do the job. In fact, he developed an adhesive that could be stuck to then removed from an object without even leaving a mark. That is not the definition of a strong adhesive.  Spencer had a co-worker who was in a church choir and had to make notes in his hymnal without damaging the pages. He applied some of Spencer’s failed adhesive to small pieces of paper and stuck them to the hymnal. This adaptation of Spencer’s discovery became what we now know as Post-It Notes. Spencer’s failure, when adapted to the situation, became one of the highest-grossing products produced by 3M, far from a failure. If Spencer’s colleague had not looked for a way to overcome his church hymn situation, Post-It Notes would have never been made. He looked to adapt to the situation and decided that the best thing to use was a failed adhesive from years ago. But I don’t have to tell you all about being able to adapt, do I?  You’ve all done it.  As a class, we took some big “hits” over the last year.  When we came together as Freshmen who knew we would spend half of our sophomore year at home watching each other on computer screens?  Who knew our football team would take the field this year for the first time since 2019?  Who knew it would get so cold in San Antonio that we would be without power and water for a week? But as I look out on all of you today, I am proud to report that we made it.  We learned to Zoom and maximized Google Classroom.  We melted snow for water.  We got even tighter as a class and came back together stronger than ever. In short, we adapted to these events, got up off the ground, and drove forward for the win. In what seemed like impossible situations to get out of, we were able to recover and get stronger. Nothing can stop humanity from adapting to any problem that comes our way. In life, there are going to be many challenges ahead of me and each of you. Even though it may not feel like it, we need to get ready to be adults. We will have to adapt to college, and probably many of us will be far away from home. We need to adapt to these situations to meet new people, make new friends, and learn new things. Then, after college, we need to adapt to the working world.  We need to find jobs and homes of our own. The excitement and worries that the future has in store for me are something I will learn to change with.  The world will not be easy on me, I need to change with life instead of against it. From college to jobs, to new friends, to changed relationships. The world is changing around us, are you prepared to change with it? I know you will because we have all learned to adapt. Thank you. 
Oftentimes, I believe myself to be one of the unluckiest people on Earth. While this isn’t uncommon for your average teenager, I happen to have this feeling quite frequently. As a control freak, I keep my grip on reality by attempting to limit negative outcomes while maximizing positive ones. To me, the idea of something being entirely out of my control is unnerving and frustrating. Unfortunately, no one can control everything because life inherently involves luck and chance. Often, I feel as if I always pull the short straw, and as I’ve grown, my own circumstances have continued to make life an increasingly risky game. But if given the opportunity to gain complete control over my life, I wouldn’t take it because over the past seven years, my life’s unlucky and uncontrollable situations have undoubtedly shaped me into a better person. If you don’t know me personally, I have a very tragic talent for being extremely clumsy. For me, the seemingly simple act of walking often leads to bruises and scratches. As an athlete, clumsiness-- along with a strong competitive nature-- opens up a multitude of opportunities for broken bones, twisted ankles, and pulled muscles. (As you can see right here with my broken wrist so being on this stage with stairs right in front of me is extremely scary). Since the fifth grade, I haven’t gone a year without at least one injury. Clearly, this is a bit unlucky, right? At first, I thought so too. In my book, however, those were the lucky injuries. Those were the ones I could always bounce back from. On the other hand, my unluckiest and most consistent talent, which basically defines my entire athletic career, is my unnatural and surprising ability to get a concussion in any given situation. As ridiculous as this sounds, I seriously do have an uncanny talent for getting concussions. In any contact sport, concussions are a given risk, but with girls' soccer having the second-highest concussion rate among high school sports (UPMC), my chances of getting a concussion are significantly higher. With already bad odds, I always took extra precautions to avoid injury by wearing ugly, bulky headgear: like this concussion headband (show concussion headband). Whether heading a soccer ball, hitting the ground, or even someone else’s head, this headband is supposed to provide a certain level of protection for common areas of impact. However, in my very unfortunate case, this headband provides little protection, as more often than not, soccer balls slam directly into my face instead of the headband. (Let me illustrate this phenomenon for you.) Unfortunately, even outside of soccer, my odds are not much better. Oftentimes, by simply existing, I am prone to concussions. By the end of my eighth-grade year at TMI, I had sustained multiple concussions from several activities including soccer, basketball, and surprisingly, science challenge. With my reputation and my own little gravitational force field surrounding my head, I was basically an urban legend under the constant threat of flying objects. However, there’s one occasion, which occurred on our end-of-the-year field trip, that really proves the enormity of my unluckiness. Though my memory is slightly vague, I remember my entire eighth-grade class had been on a basketball court at Mo Ranch. On one side, I was talking to a group of my friends, and on the opposite side, a group was playing with my soccer ball. Suddenly, I heard my name being called, and as I turned around, I felt the sting of my own soccer ball colliding with my face and immediately collapsed (and a huge thank you to Andy Cubriel because that was one of the funniest ways to conclude TMI middle school). Looking back at this moment, neither I or my friends know how this is statistically possible. With an entire basketball court and over fifty kids, there had to be a multitude of perfectly coordinated events in order for my soccer ball to travel untouched directly into my face. As you can see, the laws of physics are obviously conspiring against me. But despite my relatively light-hearted attitude, concussions are serious, complex injuries with a multitude of symptoms including but not limited to memory loss, headaches, nausea, depression, light sensitivity, lack of focus, and brain fog. There’s also no straightforward timeline for recovery, but it can range anywhere from a couple of days to weeks, months, or even years. However, most importantly, after any concussion, “there is a greater susceptibility to sustaining more concussions and any subsequent concussions occur more easily and often take longer to resolve” (Tator). At the beginning of my junior year, I received yet another concussion during soccer. Immediately after my head slammed into the ground, darkness blanketed my vision, and I was physically unable to open my eyes. Like clockwork, the headaches, nausea, and dizziness swept over me. However, as I laid motionless on the ground, the realization of this situation tore me apart. It was only one unlucky hit, and yet, I knew that I was about to lose everything. This final concussion meant no more soccer. Ironically, with a less than functional brain and multiple concussions already under my belt, I returned to school three days later. As a junior with four AP classes, I believed that I couldn’t lose any time on recovery. I attempted to build a facade of strength, but my post-concussion symptoms always came rushing back. I had almost every single textbook symptom. However, unlike my previous concussions, reading became an excruciating task. Before, words flowed through my mind with ease, but after my concussion, even simple assignment instructions left my brain in shambles because words, letters, and numbers physically moved around the page. But even with my inability to read, I was unwilling to rest. I had already lost soccer, and I was determined to not lose what little control I had left in my life. My confidence continued to falter, and I came to the realization that I was no longer the well-rounded, all-AP student-athlete that I used to be. Instead, I was missing homework, failing classes, and struggling to even complete a full day of school. By the end of the fall semester, I was at rock bottom. I just didn’t care anymore. Two weeks before midterms, Mr. Kountz requested to meet with me, and this brought the severity of my situation to light. With my lowest grade being a 16.32 (PAUSE LOOK UP and I’m so sorry mom and dad because I did not tell you that), I was terrified of Mr. Kountz. However, instead of berating or reprimanding me, Mr. Kountz simply asked me to be kinder to myself. He emphasized that my recovery required time and patience. Throughout the first semester, I hadn’t shown myself any compassion. I attempted to ignore my symptoms, which resulted in continuous and inevitable failure. I was extremely discouraged because I had no control over my brain and the symptoms I was experiencing. Despite believing that I was at rock bottom, Mr. Kountz still had confidence in me, and together, we created a plan to help me finish out the last few weeks of first semester without completely flunking out while also focusing on my recovery. However, my first job was to accept my brain’s new limitations and recover, and for the first time in almost four months, I actually felt hopeful again. After actually taking time to rest my brain, I felt like an entirely new person during the second semester of my junior year. I still wasn’t a perfect student, and I definitely never will be. I still have horrible habits. I procrastinate a lot, spend too much time on my phone, and forget things all the time. However, after learning to accept the new and unfortunate limitations of my brain, I learned the importance of redefining my goals. For me, this meant placing emphasis on things that I am actually passionate about such as photography, science, reading, and most unexpectedly, soccer. And for those of you wondering how I managed to convince my mother to let me even step foot on a soccer field again, this monstrosity is how (display THE HORRIBLE EVIL CONCUSSION HELMET). But by focusing on my capabilities rather than my inabilities, I’ve been able to adapt, relearn, and rediscover what truly makes me happy despite the hardships I faced last year. TMI, life is wildly unpredictable, so I urge you to look for the good in your life. Bad things are going to happen. They might make you feel luckless. They might get in the way of your goals, discourage you, and even make you unhappy. But learn to accept it, move on, grow, reorient, and try not to get hit in the head. Thank you.
I distinctly remember waking up to the sound of my alarm blaring to an all too familiar sound. I slammed the top of the alarm as I had every morning before, but I knew this morning was different. Up until that moment the true reality of what I had gotten myself into had not truly settled in, the days and months leading up to me coming to TMI had seemed more like preparation for a summer camp than moving into a boarding school, but in that moment staring at my ceiling as my roommate stirred across the room, everything suddenly hit me at once. The only thing left in my mind was the thought, “I messed up really bad this time”.  School had been one of the places I despised most in the world, and now I had gotten myself stuck living there for the rest of the year. The strenuous series of events that ended up with me standing here today all started 2 years before I first came to TMI. I had lived most of my life on the northside of Houston in The Woodlands and in my mind this was the place that I thought would always be my home. I had imagined my friends and I all going to the same high school and graduating together, but none of this was meant to be. One night at dinner my parents asked me how I felt about moving, and not realizing the seriousness of the question, I agreed that living in a new city could be interesting and not much more discussion of the subject was brought up. I went on with my life like normal, thinking nothing of the conversation until a couple months later it was brought up again, but this time it was not a question. I was told that my dad was going to be switching jobs and that we would be moving to Corpus Christi after the school year ended in a few months. As many kids would hearing this news I did not take it well. I hated the idea of leaving my home and my friends. From my stubbornness and anger the idea began to form that I would simply just not leave. My best friend and I began to plot how I could stay by living with him and how fun it would be for us to be able to live together, but as these plans grew so did my determination to stay. And with it anger began to build up at the idea of leaving. As expected when I finally had built up the courage to confront my mom with these plans it did not go as well as I had planned out in my head, the next few months leading up to us moving where a constant routine of fighting and begging to be able to stay. The more I was told no the harder I pushed back and the more hopeless things seemed. What seemed like my whole life was either packed up in a truck or disappearing behind me in the rear view mirror. As we drove from what I thought was always going to be my home I started to feel anger rise up and boil within me. Instead of trying to look on the brightside and look forward to all the new things I would be facing, all I could do was dwell on the past. And everything I could have had if none of this had happened. As months passed all I could feel was anger, and  the darker my view of everything was becoming. I blamed my parents for what in my mind seemed like ripping me away from what I thought was the only thing that could make me happy. I became rude and short tempered with the people around me. The only thing I wanted or cared about was being able to go back to Houston. I even began to push away anyone who tried to become close to me, because I saw them as just another thing trying to keep me there and force me away from what would make me happy. My life had become a repetitive period of highs and lows, each making me want to go more. The only times I would look forward to where breaks when I would get to go back to Houston and hangout with my friends and each time I would dread having to go back to Corpus once that break was over. I had become so focused on the idea that this was the only place I could be happy. The more I focused on this idea, the darker things became around me, as I fueled the negative spiral I had forced myself into. I knew I couldn't continue in this cycle but, I didn't know what to do anymore or how to help myself. Half way through the  year with my actions and mindset continuing the same desperate way they had been, my parents finally decided that they needed to set things straight. Almost a year had passed and I had shown no signs of giving up on the idea that the best place for me was back in Houston where I felt I belonged. I could either try to change the way I had been acting and stay in corpus. Or the second option was one that at first seemed even worse than the situation I was trying to get myself out of. To go to a boarding school. I had finally come to terms with knowing the foot had been put down by my parents and there was no going back to the place that I had been hanging onto for so long. It was now something that I knew would not be possible. I was left with only two options. And only one seemed possible in my mind. I had turned living in Corpus into such a prison that it only reminded me of all the bad things that had happened during the course of me living there. The only way I felt that I could work with the new hand I had been given was if I left. It was a step further then what had thrown me into such a downward spiral the first time. Since before I had family and my dog, no matter how hard I had made things on myself, but now I would truly be going into this alone. In a place I had never been, and people that I had never met before. But it was the only way I felt I could make things work, with a clean start to try to be better than I had been before. After a long process of visits, tours, meetings and applications I knew that this was truly for the best no matter how hard or difficult it seemed. All of this changed however as I woke up to the sound of that alarm blaring, for the first day of school. As i layed in my bed all the positivity I had tried to build up was slowly being drained away. My mind was filled with worry as I thought about all the ways that things could go wrong. As the year began I struggled to get into the habits of a new school and dorm life. As the year went on I fell into the new routine of my life here, but no matter how hard I tried, I was still angry. I felt confused and not sure what to do, or where I was meant to be. But the more I thought about it there was really nobody to blame but myself. The whole reason I ended up in the scenario that had led me to this point was all because of me. The only person who had really stood in the way of me being happy was myself. As the school year was coming to an end I was faced once again with the decision of what I wanted to do. Even though I had the same two options, this time I decided things would be different. Whether or not I decided to return to TMI or go back to corpus. I had decided I would stick with it for the next 2 years, and I would change my mindset and be positive about my choice and be happy where I was. Looking at my year at TMI I realised that I had made good friends who had been there for me, and i met the guys that I now consider to be like my brothers while living in the dorm. This time instead of going to a new place. I would be going somewhere that felt like home and with people who were like my family. It had taken me years to learn, but I had finally begun to understand that sometimes the greatest enemy you face is yourself. You determine what you can and cannot do. Any situation can become bad if that's how you want to perceive it, but in the same way, any bad situation can be made much better just by trying to make the best of what you have to face. Your mindset is one of the greatest tools you have once you learn to control it. And with it anything is possible. 
It is my opinion that any chapel talk that hopes to stick into the tiktok length attention span of the average TMI students brain, needs to clearly state what it's about very early on in the talk while all the listeners are still awake.To put it bluntly I want to talk about time, specifically how we handle it with our habits and how making tiny changes now can change the trajectory of your whole life. Now, the genesis of this talk is a TMI 2015 convocation day video, which was in fact the first glimpse I had into TMI life before I was a student, and it got me thinking about time. Every single person in that video, with the exception of some of our ancient faculty and staff, is no longer ats TMI .when that video was filmed however they were just students at TMI, same as me and you however the main difference between them and you currently is that their time as a highschool school student, is over, its finished for them, but for you, its not, you still have time left here, whether that be years or 77 days exactly including today. regardless, you will never again in your life be this young and It's easy to look at this statement as very depressing and sad. Rather look at it like this, never again will you have this much opportunity or potential to change the course of your life, now At the core of any good time travel movie a key point will be how any little shift or change in the past can have huge repercussions for the present. Makes logical sense right, now take out the time travel sci fi nonsense, and apply it to right now. Any action or decision you make right now in your life could have immense effects on what happens in the future and so many people fail to consider that. The best time to change your life was yesterday, and the second best is today. To quote the Roman poet horace “Dare to be wise; begin! He who postpones the hour of living rightly is like the rustic who waits for the river to run out before he crosses.” but you don’t just magically change because you want to. If you truly want to change in the most effective way possible you have to understand how little changes in our habits now completely change your future.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable or even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more. habits seem to make little difference now and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes obvious. We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much at the moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of shape. We make a few changes, but the results don’t come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn't move much. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss. But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem. The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving fromLAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.*Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant at the moment, but over the span of a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to endwell. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every month,then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you're moving slower than you’d like.Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound years down the line. Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self. Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad Habits make time your enemy. Habits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up. Imagine that you have a pot of water on a hot plate in front of you, you heat the water up until it scalds you, but nothing happens so you keep heating it up and heating it up, but it's not until you heat it from 211 degrees fahrenheit to 212 degrees fahrenheit that something actually happens, the water begins to boil A one-degree shift,seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. However, even if you try maintaining good habits it can be so easy to give up on them because you don't see results. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,weeks, and even months..This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?”If you think like this, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. If you are improving by 1% every day, which implies exponential improvement but expecting to make linear improvement, there will be an area where it will seem like nothing is happening, but it is when you finally break this plateau that you will truly see results. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about water not boiling when you heated it from 100 to 200 degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at 212 degrees. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. It is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic plates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension slowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once again, in the same fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it happens all at once. Mastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs have a quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room that embodies this perfectly “When nothing seems to help,I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.” All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time. Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits. And yet it is likely that this time next year you’ll be doing the same thing rather than something better. It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle. However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.When it comes to building habits that last—when it comes to building a system of 1 percent improvements. The problem is the direction of change. Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become. Imagine two people being offered a fun alternative to doing their homework that's due tomorrow. When offered, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to be a good student.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a bad student who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m a good student, I need to do this.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Putting off homework was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who’s a bad student. Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps like my friend gabo, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits. True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are. The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician. Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or unconsciously. Like all aspects of habit formation, this is a double-edged sword. When working for you, changing your identity can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, though, changing your identity can be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity. Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are the type of person who likes music. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete. Each time you encourage your cadets, you are a leader. Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well. But the true question is: “Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice at every moment. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone. Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits. Lastly TMI if you remember anything from my incessant rambling about time and habits today, remember this quote from the great cinematic masterpiece Kung fu Panda, delivered by the wise master oogway. “Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift, that is why it is called the present” Thank you 
Every day from kindergarten to 8th grade, we would have a daily chapel to begin every school day. These chapel days would be led by the school’s headmaster, Mr. Webster. Mr. Webster is not only one of the best speakers I have ever heard, not only one of the best role models ever, but he is one of the best people I have ever met. He is the example of a perfect, loving person. Mr. Webster, also known as El Guapo, is a tall man who loves wearing his suits with blue jeans. He is someone who made an impact on everyone. Ask anyone who knows him, and they will say how much they love him. Even when I went to my sister’s chapel talk back in 2015, I was asked many times by TMI faculty about Mr. Webster. Everyone knows him because he just is so great. Everyday during chapel, he would show a clip of a movie, and then he would talk about a life lesson that was shown in that movie. He would talk about laziness or how to use our values to bring up a better life for ourselves. There are infinitely many quotes he had that are beautiful, however, my favorite one is “Let love and honesty rule your life. Take those words love and honesty and write them on the tablet of your heart. And you will win a good name, and a good name is worth more than all the money in the world.” This wonderful saying was spoken almost every day by Mr. Webster. What he meant by “name” is someone’s reputation or character. Someone’s reputation is more than their wealth, where they go to school, their job, or anything else. A person’s character defines who they are better than anything else. Think about some of the best historical figures in the world. Think about five of the best people in history. You probably thought of people like Gandhi, MLK, Muhammad Ali, Abraham Lincoln, or even Albert Einstein. All that mattered was their character. No one thinks of the wealthiest people in history when talking about the best people. I doubt anyone thought of Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. Which proves that someone’s name is better than everything else. People would much rather prefer someone who can create a positive impact on the world rather than someone who does not. I strive to have a good reputation, and I bet most people listening would agree that my reputation is definitely not the worst, but definitely not the best. I can do better and so can most. People in this room would want to be remembered after they leave TMI. The best way to do that is to take the words love and honesty and write them on the tablet of your heart. As I reflect on the people who gave me love and honesty, I think of when I was a 10 years old always being at the mosque during the month of Ramadan. I always would hang out with my brother’s friends, so everyone would be a lot older than me. Some people were in their 20s and they seemed like old men to me. I was the youngest in that group by far. All of the older teens and 20 year olds would always treat me like the baby in the group and would be super kind. Everytime we would play basketball, they made it easy for me to score and even picked me up for me to dunk. Everytime we would eat dinner, they would make sure I had food first even though most of the time, they would fast while I was too young to. They always did the best they could to make me feel included. They treated me with respect even though I was just a tiny baby to them. One person who comes to mind when thinking about people with a great name is one of my favorite teachers I have ever had, Mrs. Duke. Mrs. Duke taught English my freshman and sophomore year. Every single person who had Mrs. Duke loved her. She was the most understanding and empathetic person I have ever met. She made sure that her job was more than just teaching English. It was a more personal relationship which made it better. During sophomore year, Ramadan was during the school year. This was the first time I ever had to fast during the school day. For those of you who do not know, Ramadan is a month on the Muslim calendar where we fast, or don’t eat for an entire day to show our gratitude for what we have. It helps us think about those who do not have enough to eat. So everyday, we would be hungry from sunrise to sunset until we wake up the next day and do it over again. Mrs. Duke heard about Ramadan starting and knew two of her students were Muslims who were about to start the amazing month. She wanted to be there with us while we did it. She fasted all thirty days. Even after a couple of years, I am still shocked that she went through that with us. She made it easier knowing that we were not alone Another Mrs. Duke story was during my freshman year. Most of us came to TMI not knowing most of the class. I know most people had a difficult time finding out where they belong and where they do not. However, there is one student who was a boarder that came from South Korea. Not only that, but he came in the middle of the year so it was even more difficult to meet more people. During class, Mrs. Duke told about the student from Korea. She talked about how he is a nice kid that seems a little shy and is really into purchasing new shoes. Mrs. Duke cared about getting this student more comfortable at this new school in a new country on the other side of the world. Thankfully, because of the introduction, this new kid from Korea, Ryan Kim, is one of my best friends today. During February of my junior year, I became a squad leader, and from what I heard from everyone was that my squad had a 6th grader who was always unprepared and even had problems with keeping his uniform in shape. One day during formation, he got yelled at and seemed upset by that. When I saw him tear up, I knew he was not a bad kid who did not care about what he was doing. I knew something was wrong. Again, the only thing I heard about this kid was bad things. However, I ignored all of his previous leaders, and I tried my best to make sure he was always prepared and ready. After spending some time with him and treating him with love, honesty, and respect, he got better. I saw him become happier as well. At the end of the year during one of our last formations, he came up to me and gave me a hug and said, “Thanks Omer for helping me. I am excited for next year, and I will be better.” This year, I am glad to see this improved seventh grader become not only a better cadet, but a better and happier person. The different approach I took to lead this kid is what made a difference in him. The power of this way of leading with love and honesty can change someone for the better. I tell these stories because the way I was treated inspired me to treat others the same way. It was to prove how these words of Mr. Webster really are true. People will always remember you for your character. People will always remember you for being a difference in their life. People will always remember you for being there when needed. There are people who are not always there and only care for themselves. These are the people that won’t be known for having a good name. They may do well for themselves, however, people will not care about them down the road. I am glad I can go home everyday knowing that I was able to impact so many people so easily. All I needed was a good mindset. I needed the mindset of Mr. Webster. That amazing man must have impacted so many students for the almost 40 years he worked at that school. People have asked me many times how I am able to have an impact on so many people. It is because of Mr. Webster. It is because I let love and honesty rule my life. I took those words, love and honesty and wrote them on the tablet of my heart. I hope I will win a good name, because I know that a good name is worth more than all the money in the world.
Hi, Kifak Ça Va? In English, this sentence translates to Hi, How Are You? Are you fine? What you don't realize, however, is that each word in this phrase is in a different language. It’s three different languages combined together to form one whole, singular statement. It is a combination of English, Arabic, and French. Mixing three languages may sound pretty complicated to you, but it is fairly routine for me. I value this complexity because it is a good representation of how I grew up and how I live my life. Contrary to popular belief, my last name is neither Arabic nor French; it is actually Armenian. Some of you may know this, but the majority do not know that I am trilingual. Not only that, but I have been since I was five years old. Growing up in a house that primarily spoke Arabic and French, those languages came to me naturally. Altering every word, creating new words, and switching to different languages in one sentence is commonplace in my household. My mom and dad were both born in Lebanon, a small country located in the Middle East. My mom is fully Lebanese, and my father is half French and half Armenian. Growing up in Lebanon, French and Arabic were their first two languages, so there was no doubt that their two children would eventually learn them too. They both came here as young adults, and although adjustment was difficult, they seemed totally fine with their dichotomous world: American outside the house and something different at home. They appeared at ease with different foods, different music, and even different humor, matching their surroundings at any moment. They had friends that were like them and other, more traditional Americans, for lack of better words. Early in my life, I never realized this complexity. It was perfectly normal for me to watch Spongebob and Sesame Street in English while simultaneously speaking in Arabic or French to my mother. At times, I would also watch cartoons or acrobats on the French satellite channel TV5. And to be quite honest, I thought this is what everyone else did too. I was in, what I would call, an ethnic enclave. It was the same for my brother. I enjoyed my Lebanese and French dishes cooked by my mom while also occasionally enjoying a hot dog, a burger, or mac and cheese. I didn’t have much American influence at home, but I never felt out of place. I never seemed to question who and where I was and how I got here. As I started school, things got more complicated. I slowly started realizing that most people I met did not have families similar to mine. For most, English was the only language with the occasional Spanish speaker. No one seemed to have the complex culinary experience I had had. I began to ask myself: “How did I get here?” when I would talk to my parents about our family history. I could not comprehend how a French-Lebanese girl ended up in San Antonio, Texas as a native-born American citizen. I quickly learned that I wasn't like the people next to me, and at such a young age, that did nothing but make me question myself and my interests. Growing up is hard. We never talk about it ourselves, but we all know it. We are constantly overthinking and over-stressing about every situation, whether good, bad or somewhere in between. In short, our minds are all over the place. However, the one constant in growing up is wanting to blend in. This was no different for me. At such a young age, it was hard for me to understand the dynamics of the world, and I could never understand why I felt this way. I was confused about how I felt so in place at home but never did when I was at school. As I started first grade, I would bring my pink, polka-dotted, embroidered backpack set to school with me just like any other seven-year-old girl. I would place it in the cubby with my name on it, again, just like everyone else; I felt connected as, on the surface, it looked like I had the same things as the kids around me. I loved my backpack set. I would get excited over the vibrant colors and the keychains that I would adorn it with. However, the key part of the set was the lunch box. Every day, before school, my mom and I would pack my food in a Thermos. I loved my Lebanese food and would always choose it over anything else offered to me. Something to know about Lebanese food is that it's got a lot of spice and, quite frankly, can look a bit Martian at times, but to me, that didn’t matter because that is what I loved. Glancing over at my friends’ lunches, it looked like a whole collection of American staple dishes. Cute peanut butter sandwiches, bagels, and rice crispy treats, just to name a few. Personally, I love a good bagel, but I also love my home-cooked meals. Pulling out my hummus felt awkward, but I did it anyway. At first, it was fine as no one was paying attention to what I ate. But, the one time that someone did catch it, my old feeling of disconnect returned. The statement “eww” spoke to me as if it was a whole paragraph and not just one three-lettered word. Although it was such a short statement, I felt a quick switch in my emotions, not just from happy to sad, but from confident to ashamed. It felt like all my questions of “How did I get here?” were valid as I genuinely felt like I was not where I should be. For years, I stuck with the mindset that I should kick out the traditions I grew up with in order to fit in. I would continue to pack the same food, but instead of proudly placing it on the table, I would sheepishly cup it in my hands under the table. I allowed the one incident to control my future actions, and I became my worst enemy. It was a spark that led to being ashamed and confused for many years to follow. Another American tradition for many is summer camp. Hearing all about it, it sounded like something that I would have loved to do. Going away for two weeks, staying up until 2 am, and spending unlimited time in pools and rivers are things that I love to do. I went to day camps all over Texas growing up, but because my extended maternal family was so far away, I would take a big chunk out of my summer to go visit them in Lebanon. While my friends were at summer camp, I would leave San Antonio for two months every summer and go to Lebanon. Two months is a long time to be virtually disconnected from society back at home, but I didn’t mind it much. For me, my summer looked quite different. I did not do the same things my friends did at camp. But instead, I did my own things that brought me joy. In San Antonio, I don’t have any family other than my mom, dad, brother, and grandma. As a result, being with my family in Lebanon was what I really cherished. What I enjoyed most about my summers was working with my family in our family restaurant. This restaurant is and has been very important in my life. My family has been running it since my mom was a child herself. She grew up running the restaurant and exposed me to its working functions when I was a little girl. Yes, I did not have the experience of going to camp, but being at the restaurant was important to me. It was a family tradition. It may sound weird that I enjoyed spending my summer far from my friends, but Lebanon is where I made a lot of my memories growing up. On my mom's side alone, I have 11 direct cousins ranging from ages 13 to 32, which partially explains why I loved being there more than here over the summer. There was always someone to hang out with.My summer days consisted of me waking up, going on a walk to my family garden, hanging out with my cousins, and working at the restaurant. I felt comfortable in these situations because I was never thinking about how different my lifestyle was compared to those around me. At night, I would go out with my cousins down to the village square where my family was from. I loved every second of it. I loved being placed in an environment where it seemed like everyone around me understood the things I thought made me stand out at home: the foods I ate, the way I lived my life, and the numerous family traditions I would attend to all year. Coming home was always bittersweet for me. I was always excited to see my friends whom I had not seen in a while, but also upset about leaving my family and going back home and putting 7,000 miles between us once again. To say that I did not miss my friends and that part of me did not wish that I had the opportunity to go to summer camp would be a lie. I left my second home with a mindset that I needed to get back to San Antonio to continue my life. It wouldn’t bug me because I knew that I would come back. It didn’t feel out of the ordinary to return home for me, but I didn’t realize the impact it would have on me until I returned to school. I was unable to have those classic camp discussions with everyone around me. I didn’t have those staying up until 2 AM memories. To put it in its simplest terms, I didn’t have any of the same memories those around me had. All I knew was that deep down inside, I loved the memories I had made but was irritated that my summer was different in what I considered an “awkward way.” No one said it to my face, but being so young, my head still trailed back to the “ew” I had once gone through. It took a while for me to realize it, but I was proud of myself and who I was when placed in a comfortable situation with people similar to me, but ashamed when I was around those who were different. I noticed that although I had rough experiences in the past, it was I who began to shelter myself. As I grew older and started branching out, I allowed myself to show off parts of myself that I wouldn’t have before. Often, people think that one significant, groundbreaking event is needed to change one's mindset, but I believe that something is still changing, no matter the severity of the change. For me, simply exploring the world around me, opening my eyes to everyone around me, and opening my ears, was what helped me change. This wasn’t done overnight; rather, it took many years of different experiences. As I grew older and began to see the differences in the world, I noticed that I simply began to cherish the differences, which pushed me into a new mindset. Although I wasn’t and still am not the most expressive of who I am and what my background is, it is a step in the right direction to simply be proud of who I am when asked about it. For a while, I considered it embarrassing to even speak French or Arabic in front of my friends, but now it seems regular to me as I have changed the mindset I had once created for myself. It is important to remember those critical memories, even if they were bad, because, in one way or another, they will shape the person you become as you grow up. I am not saying that you need to dwell on the experience, but instead of remembering them as bad, use them to your advantage. Do not allow yourself to be your worst enemy. Self-questioning is okay because it promotes growth and self-understanding. Self-doubt is terrible because it leads to undue hesitation and withdrawal from others. I wish I had learned that earlier. Never allow yourself to think you should be embarrassed by the things you should be proud of. How could you ever be yourself if you don’t stand by yourself? As Timothy Mouse once said in Disney’s Dumbo, “The very things that hold you down are going to lift you up.” I am now perfectly fine with where I came from. I am now perfectly fine with showing off the family traditions I have. I am happy and perfectly okay to be a mixture of French, Armenian, Lebanese, and American. Melange Hilou.
So, if you ever want hummus, let me know. Thank you. 
In the words of the great Kenny Rogers, You gotta know when to hold 'em, and you gotta know when to fold 'em. Life is a mental game - it's about how you choose to play the cards you're given.
“All in”, I announced, as an over-hyped me pushed my dignity along with every single one of my chips into the center of the poker table. I stared right into Chris Goldsbury’s clear blue eyes as I shoved everything into the pot, hoping to catch the slightest glimpse of stress or uncertainty in his face gained from my calling his bet. To my horror, he just aimed his usual friendly smile back at me. It was only him and I left in the hand, and we had both put it all on the line. It was the final hand of the night, and I had chosen to leave my fate in the hands of luck. Lucky for me, I had been having no shortage of it that night. Just five minutes prior to going all in, I was balling. I felt like I had luck on my side and was on top of the world as I had been winning so much that I was ready to cash in my chips and go buy both Boardwalk and Park Place. It was around 11:55 PM when I asked the house, Carlo Miggins, to cash out. To which he replied, “just wait five more minutes.” I sat back down at the table and, feeling lucky as I was, allowed my friends to coax me into playing another hand. Chris played the hand with unmatched confidence and aggression, despite usually being a conservative and restrained player, causing everybody besides me to fold their cards. He knew his hand had a high value, as he bet more and more money every chance got, with a smug goal of forcing me to match his bet to extract maximum dollars from my wallet. I had a solid hand and was already in too deep by the time Chris went all in. It came down to just the two of us, and Chris had caught me in a flustered state. He realized that the last thing I wanted to do was fold my cards and let my winnings as well as my ego take a hit on the last hand of the night, so he exploited me in my state of delirium. I briefly contemplated folding my cards as I would only be losing about a quarter of my money instead of risking it all, especially when I knew all signs pointed to his hand being stronger than mine. Despite this, I dropped my poker face, allowed my pride to take the wheel, and let any remaining sense of reason fade into the void I call “Yolo” as I reached for all the rest of my chips to match his colossal bet. I was caught dead in the heat of the moment as the whole room gathered around our table, bringing the volume and the pressure to an all-time high. The most humble and sportsmanlike smile crept across Chris’s face as he turned over the winning hand, taunting me back into the depths of my own mind and my now empty wallet. I had lost everything, all in one hand, because of one decision. Similar to poker, life can be a game of luck. There are times when you can make all the right moves and things can still go wrong, and it’s times like these that cause players to stray from their logic. But, in the long run, if you learn to keep your head on your shoulders and continually make the right moves under the right mindset, it can pay off in both games as your odds of winning will be maximized. Although we do not have control over the cards we are dealt, we have constant control over how we let our “luck” affect us mentally. In order to achieve a winning mindset, you have to find your poker face: a mental zone where you allow nothing and no one to phase your outlook on the game. To hold your poker face is to fortify your mind by using your logic to find the best possible outlook. To drop your poker face is to betray yourself by giving out free information to your opponents as well as giving up your mental leverage. Your mind is your most powerful weapon, as it is the only thing that stays within your control in any given situation. The moment you let your poker face slip and allow yourself to act under the influence of your own emotions is the moment that your rationality leaves you and your odds become one hundred percent a gamble. One impulsive decision can sting you in the short term, but one small adjustment to your mindset can last a lifetime. That night as I lay broke on Carlo's couch, I thought about the large change in my wallet and the root of it.  Although my success up to that point had been dependent on luck, I still allowed it to get to my head and inflate my ego. I was up big and I felt as if I could play all week without losing a hand. The luck and therefore success I had boasted on the night was completely beyond my control yet it was the thing I was most focused on. I had allowed my emotions to push me into a state in which I completely disregarded logic and instead acted upon my feelings. This sense of pride and excitement paired with the pressure of the final hand as well as the yells of all my friends hijacked my brain and caused me to make a decision that took me off my spaceship and brought me back down to earth. I asked myself “why did I do that?” genuinely trying to scan my own mind for an answer. My problem was that I never stopped to think about how I could better play my cards, instead, I allowed my cards to play me. The way I would play the game was solely based on my current situation, causing me to just go with the flow and leave no space for strategy while leaving all the space for luck. I just mindlessly called the bet because in the midst of all the chaos, the thought of folding bored me. Although this moment was insignificant compared to other mistakes I've made, it occurred to me then that this was something that went beyond just the poker table; something that occurred in my life on the regular. The thought of making another reckless decision on the basis of practically nothing ate at me, and I realized that I needed to better develop my mindset. My poker face and rationality had gotten lost somewhere along the way and I was looking at life through whatever I felt in the present moment. I let fleeting things that happened dictate my mood and my actions, all while these things were completely beyond the realm of my control. What I needed was a simple change in the way I let these situations affect me. Now, for those of you who aren’t familiar with poker, I apologize if the part I just explained made as much sense to you as someone telling stories about something usually associated with gambling to a bunch of students in chapel. However, there is a lot more to poker than just winning and losing. Despite being a game of luck, an experienced player will almost always end the session with more chips than a rookie. The experienced player, think Chris, has learned to keep an unreadable poker face, giving himself important rational-based decision-making skills over the rookie, think me, who allows his emotions to play into his actions, eventually not being able to control himself properly. The more I let my emotions influence how I play the game, the more my odds are taken out of my hands and placed in the hands of Lady Luck. Having a great decision-making process is significant not only in poker but also in everyday life. Like with any challenge that you face, if you can keep your cool while facing an adversary, you can better control the course of your game and create better odds for yourself. Competition is important; without it, we would lose motivation to win, to overcome the other person, group, or task we face. If everybody always won, no drive would exist to accomplish great things; we would fail to ever advance our positions in life. Circling back to poker, you are not only playing against the people at the table around you, but you are also playing against challenges you come across in your daily life. The world can often be like the casino in the way that it doesn’t want to see you win. Only so many people get to make the spot for that job you want, that college you want to go to, that starting spot on the team, etcetera. This leaves the responsibility of winning in your hands alone, which can be tough when every move you make at the table has the potential to shake up your life. Don’t let your guard down and let your emotions get the best of you; doing this will only reduce your chances of success and cause you to become rash instead of strategic. It is important to keep your mental prowess away from your opponent's grasp so they can't gain a mental advantage over you in any competition. Displaying emotions will not only fuel your actions and the extremity of them, but it also allows your opponent to utilize your feelings against you. If you can keep your conscience safe from any manipulation, you can be in perfect control of your situation. Now, here's where I play my next card - Paul, of Tarsus. I know if you're awake right now you're probably thinking, “Ollie, now you're gonna try to play the Bible card?” But, let me tell you, Paul is my ace in the hole. Despite not knowing his last name, I know that he fits in this talk, trust me. Paul was able to fend off countless attempts from the world to take his chips, and I think it came from learning to master his poker face. First, they threw him into prison, to which he responded with “Great, now I have more time to write some letters to my friends I’ve always wanted to write.” Next, they realized he was enjoying his time in prison and so they released him, to which he responded with “Awesome, now I can go visit my friends face to face.” Shortly after, they threatened to kill him. He replied, “Please do, I’d love to meet God.” Now, imagine that. Just try to imagine a way that you could beat someone who plays like that. Your odds of winning are one in a million. What could you do to beat someone who finds a win in every outcome? I’ve heard it's said… “You can’t drown a man who always keeps his head above water.” Paul found a way to float, even when the waters were rising. Aside from the story I just told you, Paul endured three different shipwrecks in which he lost family and friends and he was whipped countless times because of his religion. Yet through all of this and more, Paul never once let his poker face slip. His surroundings, his opponents, and the current course of his game were irrelevant to his demeanor, as he was able to keep a steady sense of serenity through any and every storm. Paul understood that the things that happened to him were completely and utterly beyond his control, so he realized that worrying about them would be a waste of his chips, and he decided not to let them change his game plan. He was consecutively dealt terrible cards over and over throughout his whole ministry as an apostle, yet he stuck to his poker face, giving him the mental leverage he needed over his enemies and ultimately making himself unbeatable. Now that I’m all out of aces and the final hand is approaching, I'm gonna go all in, again. Only this time, I thought about it. This time, I’m betting on y’all. Finding your poker face isn't about shunning your emotions, as they are a huge part of who you are. It's about finding an outlook that you can work with in any situation regardless of the cards you’ve been dealt or the people sitting beside you. I still have a long way to go in building a poker face myself, but I think I’ve got the right game plan. The beauty of both games of poker and life lies in the fact that everybody has their own unique style of playing their cards. It's important to stick to yours, and not let anything change it. Form your game plan around what you can control. Life happens, you can’t avoid that. What you can avoid is wasting time worrying about things you can’t change; things that could drag you down a way deeper hole than your luck ever could. This was never about gambling; you make your own luck. Thank you
I was never a perfect student, I got A’s on occasion but I was mostly a B student which meant I was average, mediocre, and unremarkable. My academics were not particularly noteworthy or impressive. I would go to school and constantly look for distractions to get me out of class. I would talk with my friends, ask to go to the restroom, or even enjoy the occasional fire drill just to skip that little bit of class. Distractions gave me the ability to forget that I was just an average student. As a result of my lack of focus and dedication to my studies, I often found myself behind in class becoming below average. I would struggle to keep up with the material, and my grades would suffer as a result. I would try to make up for it by studying harder and putting in more effort, but it was always an uphill battle. I was never able to fully catch up, and I would always end up feeling lost, frustrated, and discouraged, but then we hit this one unit in science class - life cycles. This topic caught my interest and made me think. For the first time, I found myself looking forward to going to class. I was fascinated by the way that different organisms developed and changed over time. This was the only class that I ever wanted to take, the only class I felt motivated to do better in. … Step 1 Airway must be secured with intubation. 7th grade came and I walk into science class expecting to pick up exactly where we left off learning about life and the many living things on earth and how they interacted with each other. All I wanted was to learn more about what makes up life and how we move but instead, I was greeted with rocks. Not even diamonds or emeralds just plain old rocks! I felt robbed, cheated, and empty. I had finally found something I was interested in and it was stripped away from me faster than a TV on black Friday. I was frustrated and upset leading me to fall back into my normal routine of looking for any distraction that came to me.  That was until my 6th-grade teacher Mrs. Mayberry offered an elective course I was able to find that passion again and study what I wanted. … Step 2 Mark the incision sites. In 8th grade, I got to experience the wonders of Forces, Motion, and Energy it never came close to life sciences but I enjoyed it. Once again I had found myself far away from the class that brought me the most joy and interest but at least it was learning about something that captured my attention. Step 3 create Incision into the epidermis. In 9th grade, I found my mind exploring the medical field and the many different pathways it has to offer. I expressed my interest to multiple different family members and I was assured that I had the ability to move forward in it. I was told that I must improve my grades to reflect good academic rigor so I did. …Step 4 Go through the dermis and superficial fascia! 10th Grade came and after a successful summer at a medical exploration camp, I was finally certain of the path that I wanted to take. I took the extra time to make sure I showed dedication in my classes. Instead of focusing on the closest distractions, I was finally beginning to find ways to not be distracted by focusing on achieving the goals that I wanted for myself. This quickly became the motivation needed to further my progress on what felt to be my impossible dream. … Step 5 Dissect through the muscle. In my junior year, I strived to do all that I could in my classes to prove myself worthy and try and break away from the feeling of being just average. The best way for me to find a way to distinguish myself was to go get experience within the field. Unfortunately, we had all just gone through a horrible pandemic, and there weren't many opportunities in hospitals or clinics in the area. This still did not stop my search, eventually, the opportunity arose with the chance to have a research internship in the summer with Emergency Health Services at the UT Health Science Center. … Step 6 Enter plural space! The internship started quickly, taking just until the end of the month for training. The process was long and difficult as I had to complete Institutional Review Board training which included studying The Belmont Report. The Belmont Report outlines the ethical principles that should guide research involving human subjects. The primary investigator wanted to explore the pre-hospital whole blood program that spread out of military healthcare to the civilian setting. Pre-hospital whole blood was important as every year pre-hospital hemorrhagic shock accounts for approximately 60,000 deaths in the United States and an estimated 1.9 million deaths worldwide. The other research intern and I got the opportunity to create a database of previous medical records to preform a statistical analysis that would reform the program. Additionally, we had the opportunity to respond to calls alongside the EMS physicians and the Medical officers of the San Antonio fire department. These heroes exposed me to many different patients with individual needs from just a simple lift alert to the patient that is fighting for their life. Step 7 Spread ribs. During my time as an intern, I had the chance to travel to Bulverde Spring Branch to see Scotty and his team at the Centre for Emergency Health Sciences they taught continuing education to all Emergency Health service providers. It was in Scotty's lab where I would encounter 2 fresh cadavers and 1 embalmed cadaver, 3 dead bodies all within 10 feet of me. Each of these participants had donated their body to science and it has gone to training doctors, paramedics, EMTs, police, firemen, military, and even interns such as myself. It was in this lab using these cadavers where the emergency health providers would hone their skills in needle decompressions, finger decompressions, amputation, thoracostomy, and even the most invasive procedure in the pre-hospital setting, the thoracotomy. Thoracotomy is one of the many surgical procedures I assisted with in the lab in which an incision is made through the chest wall in order to gain access to the organs inside the chest or thorax. These participants allowed us the gift of education, they save lives every day without being alive. They have inspired me to do good with the gift of knowledge that they left behind so humbly for me. Learning from the cadavers who gave me access to their plural cavity and the ability to deliver their heart made me recall the very moment when I found my passion in healthcare. I took a long look inside of myself and felt something in my own heart except in contrast to someone that is likely getting a thoracotomy it wasn't a gash or a wound, it was inspiration and passion. Step 8 deliver the Heart. Nov 29, 1:29 PM a notification I check my phone Summer EMT Acceptance Package Dear, Mr. Liang, We are excited to have you in our program, attached you will find your acceptance package. This gave me a feeling of belonging I was finally getting a step closer to something I considered an impossible dream. The chances of one surviving a thoracotomy are about 15%. The chance of a pre-med student becoming a doctor is similar. These odds are not in my favor but let it be known with the passion, drive, and sheer satisfaction I get out of helping my patients I can make it on my quest to dream my impossible dream. Once I was just an average kid who never impressed or disappointed anyone. Now I am that same old average kid that will impress with my passion for pursuing this career for my own sake. TMI, let us not be afraid to take the road less traveled, to follow our dreams and pursue our passions with all of our heart. For it is in doing so that we can truly live, and make a difference in the world. Let us encourage and support each other in this journey, and together, let us rise to the challenge of finding and following our passions. For it is through our passions that we can find meaning, purpose, and joy in life. So let us seize this opportunity, and let our light shine bright, inspiring and motivating those around us to do the same. Together, we can create a brighter future for ourselves and for those around us. Thank You!
"Why am I doing this?" That was a question I had in mind ever since middle school. Korea’s education system makes everyone fixate on grades and getting into those top 3 colleges, resulting in the craze of after school academies trapping students often past midnight every single day. During my time in Korea, where I spent most of my life, I didn’t know the purpose of me as a person. I felt like I was just wasting my time doing homework, for just some quiz, and a rank that didn't mean much. Summer of 2019, I decided, I needed a break from this cycle. My parents and I decided to look into studying abroad, which was always in the back of my father’s mind. When we found TMI, we fell in love. It was a small private school, away from the city, surrounded by nature. As I was looking for something completely different from my experience in Korea, it was perfect. Stereotypical statement from immigrants, but for me, America really was the land of opportunities. It was a second chance in life where I was given a blank canvas and was able to make that painting whatever I wanted it to be. However, this new painting I had to do was very far from home, and very far from what I was used to. Living by myself, alone in the dorms was probably the biggest change other than the language & cultural barrier I experienced. I didn’t have my parents to tell me what to do. I was ecstatic at first, indulging myself with snacks, ramen, and laying in bed with dirty clothes and shoes on. Those are some things I would never be able to do at home. However, living in the dorms came with responsibilities that I didn’t realize at first. Now, everything was up to me, and with too much freedom given to me, I was a wreck. The first two months flew by, and covid hit. Had to come back home for a while, and 6 months later I was on the flight back to Texas to start my sophomore year. This time, it was online though. All of us in the C dorm weren't allowed to leave the building, and I was bored out of my mind. Since I didn’t have much work to do, all I did was online shopping, watching random movies, and just killing time. I had everything I wanted from when I was in Korea. But soon enough, I was becoming a couch potato, as lazy as I can be. Laundry started to pile up, garbage was overflowing, unopened amazon packages stacked up against a corner, and my grades were going down. One of those days, I was in the shower, after watching South park for the past 3 hours, and procrastinating on math homework. I started thinking. Even though I thought life was better than before, I was doing the same thing I was doing in Korea: wasting away my time. My drawing on the blank canvas started to look like the one I had in Korea. I was devastated when I realized that I was going back to my old self. I wanted to be better, and I knew I could if I actually tried. That night, I made myself a promise. I need to be better than who I was the day before.  In my head, a new question popped up. “What can I do to make myself better?” Self improvement became my life motto from that point on. The next day, I shaved my head, determined to change myself. I wanted to move on from my past, and be a whole new person. It all started from a shower thought. I started to identify my flaws and pointed out two of them: discipline and health. The thing I struggled the most with was discipline, especially time management. I would always give up, sit on my phone and just waste time, when I got bored or tired. That led to assignments and chores piling up. If anyone remembers Paul's chapel talk from last year, he said “Ryan was always doing math in his room.” I was. Kind of.  Half the time, I was watching stupid tiktoks. Other half, I was sitting at my desk, zoning out.  Procrastination is a scary thing.  By the end of that quarter, I had 17 missing assignments for math due in 3 days. It was a nightmare. I started to take time management more seriously. I figured improving my productivity would help. I started by fixing my sleep schedule, by strictly going to bed at 10, waking up at 6:45 even on weekends. I started to leave my phone on the other side of the room and got rid of tiktok. I set a time table for myself, where I would start my afternoon by doing homework till dinner. Now, I had the entire time after dinner to relax, do my chores, and sleep early for a better tomorrow. As a result, my grades were going back up too. Next issue was physical health. When I first got here, I was around 165 lbs, zero muscle. Couldn’t even run the straight part of the track without stopping or do a single pushup. Sophomore year, I was in the fitness class with coach Tony, and I tried my best to not actually work out. I was too embarrassed to show others that I was weak. Stupid ego right. One day, coach Tony gathered all of us, and taught us how to work out. He taught us how to bench, squat, and deadlift with proper form. I was devastated. I couldn’t bench the bar, pick up the hex bar, or squat the bar. Just the bare bar. Then, coach Tony made us run on the track. I was gassed after the first few seconds. I felt horrible. I decided I should just give it my best and run, and lift weights. Someday, I thought, I would be able to bench more than the bar. Someday, I will be able to run a lap. With the newly found time after finishing my assignments, I would go out for a run, and spend time working out. By spring break of my sophomore year, that someday came. I was able to run a lap. I also gained some healthy weight and was in shape again. Junior year, I even joined the football team. Although I wasn’t that good at it, I was very proud of myself. This was something that I wouldn’t even have thought of had I continued to live in Korea. From that one shower thought, I decided to make a change, and kept myself in check and pushed myself to be better. And it was working. I was becoming a better version of myself, or so I thought.Once football season was over, I was slowly becoming the couch potato again. The laundry pile grew back in the corner of my room. Empty water bottles everywhere. I had stopped going out for runs, or just any physical activities in general. I also pushed myself away from others, because I was too determined to figure things out on my own. Soon after, I developed pretty bad social anxiety that I couldn’t even start conversations or continue on with them. I was slowly but surely detaching myself from society, stressing out about even the smallest things. A problem I had overlooked was that I was determined to figure things out on my own. Attempting to be completely independent. That's just not how humans work, we are social beings. It wasn’t until after winter break of junior year, when I finally decided to pull myself back together. I realized, sometimes my effort alone may not be enough. I got myself to think about the question that was in my head again. What can I do to make myself better? But this time, I changed it again. What can I do to make myself better with the help of others? Again, I started the troubleshooting process. I realized I missed home. Family. Although I never mentioned it to people, looking back at it, I was homesick. I was able to see my family once or maybe twice a year, and I missed them. So, I went out and looked for things that could be a substitute for home. First, I got back into going to church regularly. I’m guessing most of y'all wouldn’t know, but there is a Korean Church by McDonalds up on I-10. To be honest, at first, the Korean Catholic church was my outlet for my Korean food needs. They serve home cooked Korean food after every service and they’re good. However, what made me return every week was the new priest from Busan who was really welcoming to me. Being one of the only teenagers there, he even gave me a position as altar server. Also with my late grandfather being a very devoted catholic, I felt at home connecting to god, and connecting to my family through him. By reconnecting with religion and some Korean food, I found myself recharging every time I went to church. I also had my closest friends, Jeongho and Matthew. We lived together for three years, and they are like my brothers now. Although we often argued about dumb stuff like why you shouldn’t have rice with chopsticks, we had a lot of fun together. I remember the three of us going to cars and coffee on saturday mornings, or the regular trips to Target to buy useless stuff. I’m grateful for these guys, always being by my side throughout the years. And on top of that, I was lucky enough to have Major Claburn and his family to let me stay at their house over one of the breaks. Mrs.Claburn treated me like her own son, and would invite me over for dinner often. Julia and William were like the annoying siblings I never had, and Major, although not too talkative, cooked me the best steak dinners with his grill setup. They provided me with the warmth of family, and some warm and delicious t-bone steaks. Realizing the support of all these people around me, I was able to dust myself off and pull myself back together. This time I decided, I’ll set achievable goals for myself, and each time I complete those, I'd set new goals that were, again, easily achievable. I started by taking cold showers everyday, cut down on caffeine and sweets, and worked out more often. Since then, things have been back to good for me. I ended my junior year with pretty good grades, a satisfying SAT score, and most importantly, a good living habit. Now, as a second semester senior, I am still working on being better than who I was the day before. It’s a work in progress, and it all started from that one shower thought. As coach P says, quitting is the easiest way out. Never give up. Keep pushing, and be better than who you were the day before. All of your smallest efforts will add up, and someday you’ll start noticing your improvements. There will be challenges along the way, but just remember that you are never alone. While it is great for you to try and navigate through those challenges on your own, don't be afraid to ask for help to defeat those challenges. Thank you.
It was another sunny spring day in my fifth grade year, and I was rushing to finish my breakfast because I did not want to cause my family to be late. We were on our way to St. PJ’s Children’s Home to participate in a volunteer project. I was very excited because we had never been to St. PJ’s before, and I had been told that there was a basketball court for me to play on with my friends after the project was over. After a quick 30 minute drive, we arrived at the orphanage, and I jumped out of the car to greet all of my friends. We worked for about half of the day cleaning bedrooms, sweeping kitchen floors, organizing bookshelves, and various other chores that would help the staff and residents. After the cleaning came the part I had really been looking forward to: playing. Some people went to play board games. Some people went to the arts and crafts area, and my friends and I went outside to play basketball. We split up into two teams–each team was a mix of kids from the volunteer group and kids who lived in the orphanage. The game lasted about thirty minutes, after which we all went inside to feast on the various snacks and juices provided to us. The volunteer project described above was fairly routine to me as volunteer work has been an important part of who I am for my entire life. Both of my parents came from humble beginnings, and they completely uprooted their lives for my brother and me. They came to this country with nothing to their name, and even after their decades of hard work to reach the place they are now, they continued to stress the importance of giving back to the less fortunate. My parents believed that their children should see the value of helping other human beings for no other reason than just to help. Therefore, my brother and I have been attending monthly volunteer projects since before we could remember. One of my earliest memories includes standing on top of an empty banana crate just so that I could reach over the table to help hand out bread at Haven for Hope, a homeless shelter in San Antonio. Although I have helped out at these projects since I was a young child, I never truly understood the importance of what I was doing. I simply saw the projects as a fun way to spend my Saturday afternoon with my family. However, that changed after the St. PJs' project. I made a lot of new friends that day, as spending the entire morning and afternoon cleaning and playing basketball provides ample opportunities for conversation. I specifically remember meeting one kid named Josh. Josh was my age and we shared many interests. We were both huge San Antonio Spurs fans, and we were both infatuated with the new Kevin Durant shoes that had just been released. From our favorite TV show (Avatar the Last Airbender) to the fact that we both had older brothers, we discovered many similarities and became very good friends that day. I still remember making my dad drive me all the way back to the orphanage the following weekend so I could give Josh my Spurs hat, as I had one to spare. Afterwards, while I was thinking about Josh, I wondered about what separated us. When we met we were both just kids who had done nothing but exist. Our contributions to the world were exactly the same, and we as people were very similar. Josh looked and acted like me and my friends at school yet we were all able to go home and give our parents and hug everyday, and he wasn’t. It was clear after some consideration that there was nothing that separated us; I had done nothing to earn the more fortunate life I was living, just as he had done nothing to deserve losing his parents. Our lives were only different because of the accident of our births. As I started to understand just how lucky I am, I also understood how important it would be to remember that very moment. This realization contributed to my personal growth and changed how I understand my place in this world. Without it, I might have gone through life assuming that all I was given is normal. I might not have fully appreciated how fortunate I am to have something as simple as a good family and a good group of friends, and I may never have realized how easy it is to take things for granted–I am admittedly still occasionally guilty of it to this day. Recognizing one’s privilege is a difficult thing to do. But it has changed the way I approach all aspects of my life. This can take the form of small actions such as picking up a random piece of trash or telling someone I like their outfit, or it can be in bigger sentiments such as dedicating my weekend to help raise funds to support the education of children in underprivileged countries. And most importantly it has taught me to look at the world through a lens of unconditional gratitude. By doing these sorts of things, I hope my path through this world will be defined by kindness, respect, and appreciation for the blessings I have been given. TMI, I challenge you to do the same. As our chaplain, Father Ben, preaches, there is not enough room in our hearts for both misery and gratitude, and while I understand it is easy to be defeated by all of the challenges life throws your way, make sure you are fighting to stay positive and appreciate the blessing you have been given as well as spreading them to those who need it. This does not mean sacrificing your weekend to go make food for the homeless. It can be a text to a friend who is struggling in school. It can be a thank you to your parents for all they have done. It can also be a simple prayer in your mind thanking God for your health and happiness. Thank you and Happy Birthday to my Chapel Talk Coach Mr. Ridewood.
I love my parents. I have been blessed with parents that love me unconditionally and are able to provide for me. They’ve worked so hard to give me a better life than they experienced when they were young. A better life of living, better education, and a lot of love. They were very determined and through all their perseverance made it in America. My mom was born on December 3rd, 1967 She grew up in Baghdad, Iraq. When my mom was growing up she was relatively safe. She lived with her grandma, grandpa, uncles, and aunts for most of her life in one house. She didn’t have privacy or her own room since she lived in a crowded house. Her dad wasn’t in her life. The time she saw her dad was at age 6. Her dad was always a busy man. He’d been working in Saudi Arabia for 9 years trying to make good money. When living in that house my mom was trained from an early age to learn how to clean and cook. She couldn’t play outside unless there was a guardian watching her whilst having a curfew. When going to school she had to walk to each of her schools from elementary to high school. The schooling system had a mix of boys and girls this was up until 7th grade; when the schools separated the boys and the girls into their own different schools. Her dad came back and builds a house and opens up a business for her future at age 13. My mom was enrolling in high school when Iraq and Iran went to war. The war itself lasted from 1980-1988 but the devastation my mom went through was terrifying. Constant alarming air raid sirens, electricity cutting in and out sometimes for days with no electricity, drinking water depleting, and sometimes they had no food at all. She would hide under trees since there were no bunkers outside to hide under. She would even go on top of rooftops and watch the bombers do a run-by bombing power plants. Even through all of this struggle my mom still went to high school a 10-minute walk in the heat of the danger. She’d eventually graduate from high school and get her driver’s license now at the age of 17. 1985 She would be put into an arranged marriage meeting my dad and marrying him and fleeing the country all around the age of 17. This led to a brand new chapter in my mom’s life. My dad had a very different childhood from my mom. He was born on May 2nd, 1956 but due to a mix-up of papers, he was automatically given a default birthday of July 1, 1957. He lived in a house that was made up of mud and wood. He shared the roof of the house with his mom, dad, two sisters, and two brothers. Their house had no individual rooms. They slept all on the floor. He lived by mountains in a rural area. He had no electricity, no gas, and there weren’t any cars only horses and donkeys. The village consisted of 15 families all were Christians. When my dad was around the age of 6, Iraq was in a war with the Kurdish the first of many wars with the Kurdish. This war would go from 1961-1970. One day my dad woke up and began his day as normal eating breakfast, and getting ready to start work, around noon he heard flying. He went outside and saw it was an Iraqi bomber plane, soon his entire village is engulfed with bombs. The Iraqi government thought the village was harboring Kurdish people. Even though the Kurdish wanted to take his village. Eventually, he and his family made it out of there and walked to a nearby village 2 hours away. They crossed mountains and eventually made it to the village. But, his sister who was 1 at the time had passed away. They just lost their house and a family member, at age 6 my dad became a refugee. They had to bury her in the village, they put a wooden cross as her gravestone. Over time they would leave the village and have their eyes set on settling down in Baghdad. They lived in better housing conditions, there was electricity and gas. His parents had another 5 kids, 1 girl, and the rest boys. They eventually owned a grocery store. They had my dad in school but my dad didn’t love school. My dad would fall in love with soccer and would purposely skip school to play soccer. When his parents found out they were angry and he dropped out of school in 3rd grade. Years later he fled Iraq at the age of 15 and moved to Lebanon so he could avoid being drafted into the Iraqi army. He left Iraq without anyone. When living in Lebanon he became a painter painting house interiors. Making enough to survive. He makes friends to keep him company. But then the conflict between Muslims and Christians lead to an all-out war. This led to restrictions and those restrictions made it harder to find jobs. My dad and his friends were frantically looking for work so they could survive. They took any job even if it meant burying dead bodies. In 1976 my dad at 18 years old moved to Athens, Greece under the Church World Service. This allowed him to become an American citizen and he’d set to leave for Chicago just 6 months later. He’d live with some of his friends he met in Lebanon. Taking up different types of jobs. Such as construction, working for Zenith the TV company, and a plastic company. He’d stay in Chicago until 1979, when he moved to Detroit, Michigan. Living in Detroit he had moved into 6 mile. It’s regarded as a very bad neighborhood. But through the bad, that loomed my dad he found a way to make money in a way he loved. He was on a soccer team that the club manager paid him for playing. It was known as the Iraqi team since the team consisted of a lot of Iraqis.  He would play left and right defensive but usually plays sweeper. His club manager also ran a liquor store and my dad would also work there from time to time. In his last couple of months out in Detroit, he worked in a factory making Chryslers, getting his family documents set so they can come to America. He was able to get his family to America in 1984 and met them in Detroit, where they all would move to California. He would become a manager of a liquor store and work at Western Wheels making rims for cars working those 2 jobs for 5 years. 1985 He would marry my mom due to his sisters and parents that knew my mom and would set him with an arranged marriage with my mom. They both would live in his parent’s house and my mom would give birth in 1986 to my sister. Then my brother. Then my other brother. Then my other, other, brother. They all would stay in California till 1999 where’d they moved to Houston. Where my dad became business partners with another guy in running an auto glass shop. There was another location in San Antonio. Nearing the end of 1999 they would move to San Antonio. My dad would take over the auto glass shop there within 6 months he’d completely own it. When September 11th happened both of my parents weren’t scared as they’d faced horrors before they’d seen it all. All they feared was god. Then on October 29, 2004, I was brought into their world. All was good and the rest is history. The main thing to take away from my parent’s success story is that anyone can do anything they aspire to do. They’re from two different social classes, different ages, different experiences, different education levels, and different backgrounds. Even though they are both different they still tried their best to make their situation best for themselves. My mom still went to school and get her driver’s license when they’re was an active war going on. That requires a lot of determination. My dad when left everything behind to move to a different country by himself at age 15 so he can get his family eventually in America. That requires a lot of perseverance. These are very extreme examples of perseverance and determination. Most people lose determination after a small loss and give up right then and there. Apply yourselves to be determined to anything, whether it be studying for a quiz, setting some personal goals, or going to college. Apply perseverance in practicing anything, and be persistent in doing something you love, whether it’s your basketball shot, learning new topics, or in doing more for yourself. That’s all I ask for the students of TMI to practice. No matter what your parents do, or how much they make, it doesn’t matter, all that matters is that you’re determined and persistent to achieve your goals in the end. Because at the end of the day all your parents want is for you to make it in life. So to the students what are you going to do with yourselves in life? Thank you.
